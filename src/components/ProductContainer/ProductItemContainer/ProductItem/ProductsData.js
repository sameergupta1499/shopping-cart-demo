    "cust_review": "Well, I was a bit sceptical before buying this Samsung Galaxy M10, soI bought thisphone on the second sale & placed the order for the variant ie3GB+32GB for ₹8990. Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***",
