      "cust_review": "I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box. Running Smooth.***Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...***1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal***Worst camera and ear piece is really horrible.. There is no Samsung pay also.. Honestly the worst phone to buy***",

      "cust_review": "I was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my son. I had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused 😕Finally I placed the order and bought it through Amazon.Believe me it fabulous product so far.The screen is apt and very clear.Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc.Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material. Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space.Phone is quite light weight and very smart. I chose blue color and believe me it looks classy.Only issue it does not come with earphones🤔🤔🤔I respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but I recommend this to all buyers.In nutshell its not only value for money but gud choice too.Cheers 👍🥂***Airtel/jio/bsnl sim cards works fine but handset have problem with IDEA Sim***Phone is not working***The phone delivered to me didn't had the sim card trays.Please don't buy it as it may have missing parts...***Highly disappointed because it's hot spot is not being connecting to my laptop dell d630.11.08.18 .  i got online help and was advised by the engineer to factory hard reset of the mobile and while doing so it requires the mi password which i dont remember. IN present situation my new redmi 6a is locked and like a toy of 7000/i had requested the amazon people to replace this item when i foud not connecting to my laptop but they refused to replace and sent a stero type message which of no use .  and latter on factory hard reset whose result mobile locked.***Very Bad experience..Idea Nano Sim networks are not getting detected..Redmi store reps stated that there is issue with this set..and instructed to raise a complaint ...Not sure when the technician is coming ..Fingers crossed till then.Please be careful***Good phone value for money***To say in short, its one of the best devices out there in it's price bracket. I have got three of them for my family, different colours, configs etc.Its a budget device and we must expect similar performance from it. But still a good to go for a casual user.•••••••••••••••INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••1. Device2. USB cable3. Charger4. SIM ejector tool5. Few guides(No earphones, as is with every budget & midrange device)•••••••••••••••••••ABOUT DEVICE•••••••••••••••••••As for trend goes, MI phones are value for money always. This one's no exception.▶ Screen 9/10▶ Camera 8/10 (samples included)▶ Battery 9/10 (1 day 23 hour 14 min on battery, 100% to 4%; 6hrs 50min SOT)▶ Performance 7/10▶ Build 8/10▶ Sound 8/10Overall 8.1/10••••••••PROS••••••••1. Low price bracket i.e. Budget friendly.2. Refreshing looks with rounded corner display & body.3. Light, slim phone with good build quality.4. Reasonable features & performance.5. Nice 5.45 in HD display (1440 x 720 pixels resolution), 295 PPI and 18:9 aspect ratio. Good sunlight legibility.6. Full screen gestures which removes on screen buttons for back, recents, home and increases screen area.7. No hybrid slot. Instead three separate slots, so 2 SIM and extra memory at same time.8. Dual 4g standby (enable it in settings - SIM cards & mobile network).9. Android Oreo 8.1/MIUI 10.2.1 out of box. Periodic security & bug fixing updates are provided.10. Plethora of sensors (except IR in specific).11. Pretty decent camera (samples attached)12. 32gb internal is quite sufficient13. Face unlock works good. Low light unlocking may not work properly.••••••••CONS••••••••1. Performance may be a issue as its budget device with mediocre hardware. But what to expect from extremely low budget device.3. Helio vs Qualcomm, & it will really matter in this device.4. Too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them & techies will be able to remove stubborn ones too via adb.2. No IR blaster in 6A, i do use it a lot. It's one the key features for me.5.

You get a new device with current day trend of screen & camera, AI and looks, all with ok performace.Just some tweaks here and there & it will be good to go. P.S. Its not at all meant for gaming. Though cassual games will be ok.▶ Already using 2 of 16 gb versions, my suggestion will be to get 32 gb internal, as sooner or later 16 gb runs out of space and you need to uninstall things to install others. Current apps n content consume a lot of space.▶ Even after launch of Redmi 7 series, 6A is still in shelves for a reason. It offers quice decent feature set & performance in its price bracket. None of the current devices can beat its price point. Available frequently on sale for 500 less.▶ BUT be open to other options available out there, you may shell out few bucks extra to avoid cons.***",

Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now . Mi Fan***Redmi 6A not good as 5999 mrp veri slow working Totally waste of money product. Screen quality very poor, battery no good***",

I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.***Don't buy this MI 6 Pro ,Speaker volume is very bad & LowCamera pics are not good at all special back cam having dual cam stabilization problem front cam like VGA picsHeating issueBattrey drained very Fast***Cheap Chinese product.Negatives:1. Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5\" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ₹6500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***\"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***",

      "cust_review": "It is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5. Affordable as compared to Pro Version6. Amoled Full HD7.Snapdragon 855 SoC***It is so buttery smooth and insanely fast that i don't have words to describe whole experience... Just buy it you won't regret... Its better than OnePlus 7 Pro.***it is getting heated and screen is blinking non stop***Phone stopped working after 2 days. Not switching on. Please don't buy. Also not able to return.***Oneplus, as always packs the pure raw power in their devices. Its slick, fast, smooth and much improved entertainment box now. It has stereo speakers but sadly no aux, along with that the saddest part is, there is no type c to aux dongle. Deducted two stars because of same charging speed as last year and aux missing.****Honest Review*Bought Oneplus 7 in the first sale.Delivered 2 days backUsing OnePlus for the first time. It is  just superb.Not easy to describe OnePlus 7 in a small review.Camera is fantastic.This is the first phone which is faster then the speed of my fingers :p33,000 is a handsome amount but i think this phone is value for money.If you are one who spend his good time using phone then this is best for you. Its processor saves time because now i am able to do work even more faster.Features you can easily check in product description.5/5 for camera.5/5 for processor.5/5 for shape.5/5 overall.***Well, much awaited OnePlus really stood up the wait we all did.I won't go for the pros and cons! I will go with the feel this phone has which it's competitors such as Asus, Redmi, etc doesn't at all.Yes, there are some quirks but still this is valuable smartphone your hard earned money can really buy.Your money will be on the right side with this OnePlus 7, if you're in doubt which phone to buy in 35k budget.. go with this one hands down, eyes closed. This will you that premium feel.Clean crisp display, loud stereo speakers, super fast phone, nicer camera, fastest storage, etc.Pro tip: Install GCam for OnePlus 7 and click pictures as good as pixel phones. Trust me. You'll love your OnePlus more for this. It will significantly improve your phone's camera quality at par with flagships costing 60k.***",

      "cust_review": "Wanted this for my mom. She wanted it primarily for calls. But the caller voice is distorting a lot. Very poor call quality. It's a very bad decision to buy this. Only reason to buy this is lowest sar value. But it's of no use if not for calls.Apps like YouTube and WhatsApp are not mandatory but preferred. So I'm regretting my decision.Verdict: it's good for lowest radition. So, if you're ok to use it for less calls, you can go for it. Otherwise, a strict NOUpdate: Have installed \"Phone Doctor Plus\" app and figured out that the faulty hardware is the reason for lack of clarity in the voice. On informing Amazon, they've asked to install another app and tested for themselves. On finding the fault, replaced a new phone. But new phone is also having same issue. Hence, they've refunded the money.If you are going to buy this, make sure to test it through \"Phone Doctor Plus\" app if it is passing all tests***There is no earphone in the box .

      "cust_review": "If you are planning to buy this mobile, then read this & then decide it yourself.I bought Samsung m20 in first sale, using it from last 2 weeks.As samsung launched such mobile first time at this competitive price, expected many things.Pros:1. Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***",

Happy shopping!!!***Bought this phone a lot ago. Just providing review after selling it second hand. This is an averange low end device. In this price range there are a lot of phones better than this.•Build Quality- The build quality is average, nothing appreciatable.•Camera Quality- Camera gives accurate color reproduction. That's good. But detailing is not up to the mark.•Sound Quality- The sound quality is pretty better.•Processor- The processor is not much powerful. Not for any kind of gaming. Heating issue comes on constant use of phone.•Battery- The battery life is quite bad. It have a juice of one day only if you make calls or surf a little otherwise you have to charge twice the mobile.•Price- In this price range I won't recommend it to buy. There are a lot more phones better than it in same price segment.•Overall Performance-  The phone is an average phone. If you make calls only then you can buy it but strongly recommended not to buy. There are a lot mobiles in this price segment.***The phone is my second one. 1.5 years back I bought the same phone. Review after 1.5 years of the phone.

      "cust_review": "It is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5. Affordable as compared to Pro Version6. Amoled Full HD7.Snapdragon 855 SoC***It is so buttery smooth and insanely fast that i don't have words to describe whole experience... Just buy it you won't regret... Its better than OnePlus 7 Pro.***it is getting heated and screen is blinking non stop***Phone stopped working after 2 days. Not switching on. Please don't buy. Also not able to return.***Oneplus, as always packs the pure raw power in their devices. Its slick, fast, smooth and much improved entertainment box now. It has stereo speakers but sadly no aux, along with that the saddest part is, there is no type c to aux dongle. Deducted two stars because of same charging speed as last year and aux missing.****Honest Review*Bought Oneplus 7 in the first sale.Delivered 2 days backUsing OnePlus for the first time. It is  just superb.Not easy to describe OnePlus 7 in a small review.Camera is fantastic.This is the first phone which is faster then the speed of my fingers :p33,000 is a handsome amount but i think this phone is value for money.If you are one who spend his good time using phone then this is best for you. Its processor saves time because now i am able to do work even more faster.Features you can easily check in product description.5/5 for camera.5/5 for processor.5/5 for shape.5/5 overall.***Well, much awaited OnePlus really stood up the wait we all did.I won't go for the pros and cons! I will go with the feel this phone has which it's competitors such as Asus, Redmi, etc doesn't at all.Yes, there are some quirks but still this is valuable smartphone your hard earned money can really buy.Your money will be on the right side with this OnePlus 7, if you're in doubt which phone to buy in 35k budget.. go with this one hands down, eyes closed.

      "cust_review": "fell from very short height but completely damaged both front and back glass of phone. DO NOT Recommend this phone at all !! I have been using MOTo phones since 2013 now and this is my 3rd Moto phone but highly disappointed. Service Centre is charging me repair cost at more than the actual cost of this phone!! Pathetic.***Mobile is working fine. But after one week I noticed mobile is not charging and went to mobile shop and got cheked the Moto turbo charger and they said cable is not working, it's gone. I didn't expect this bad charger from Moto company. I have raised complaint to Amazon customer service to replace mobile charger they responded intially and they told they will call me back. But none of them called. I didn't expect bad service from Amazon.***Writing dis review after 2 months of usage...works fine😍...No lagging... Quite a good camera..Sound quality is amazing due to Dolby... Gives battery of almost 1 day...I think it is a perfect smart device.. Like it...😍😍***This phone is just waste of money1. It's 4G network keeping dancing and comes to lowest signals, I tried with different sim cards and locations.After complaining to Moto customer care they asked to visit authorized service centre.And local service centre man said there no such problem with phome, instead he said it's 4G network always keep going low and high signal ,how is that possible.Actually this can be hardware problem.2 .Another problem I faced is it goes off randomly. Many times on phone calls . Suddnely it goes off and takes more than 5 minutes to start . That crazy when you are on some important call and lost conversation and then out of reach.3. BatteryHardly sustain for full day .There are better phone at this price .Just wasted buying such phone .Don't.regrett like me google about network problem of Moto g6 . There are many complains.Service centre will not help you .***I bought this smartphone 4 months ago,Camera is average, battery charges fastly, lowlight camera is not good, sometimes phone lags***I have been using Moto for past 4 years from Moto G2, then G5 and now G6. The G series have evolved very much. Coming to Moto G6.Touch Sensivity:Much improved and curved glass, makes the experience awesome. I prefer to use it, without tempered glass or screen guard, as we will miss the curved glass feel.Speed:No issues. 3GB version is sufficient for non gamers and regular useWeight:Light weight, with plastic back. Metal as in Moto G6 plus , may be bit heavierSound:Sound quality in headphone is excellent, with Dolby.Loud speaker volume is also decent. Ear piece volume should have been even better.Camera:Good at bright lightingsOther feature:C type USB - need migration if you use regular OTG pen driveAccessing power button is bit difficult. but one button navigation helpsHeadphone Jack 3.5mm at bottom, near USB port.Dedicated Memory card slot.I am very much satisfied with the product and looking to know what betterment can be made in next version. Bit challenging to Moto.***Moto G6 purchased on 13 June 2018 is dead by now. It's not responding at all. The phone had suddenly stopped working on 20 Dec 2018 (barely after 6 months), not powering on (with last remaining charge was ~95%). This happened while travelling, leaving disconnected with family & friends. Imagine if you were in a critical situation, I wish nobody should fall in such a situation at all..I don't know if it could be resolved by the motorola service center in Kolkata, despite being within warranty!Please people, don't buy Motorola now if really want to avoid this kind of situation. Their quality products (I used 3 earlier) are no more reliable. Never buy Chinese Motorola products (US motorola was far better as per my earlier experience with Moto devices)!***Before going to buy any product on Amazon every one should think twice due to Amazon's senseless policy. If you buy any product you can't assume the product quality, Right? I bought Moto G6 phone and I want to return that product because the body panel is not up to the mark. It is very delicate. Even camera is also not that much good. But when I tried to return this product they would not allow me. I asked them one question i.e., without seeing the product, how can I assume that is good or bad? But they don't have answer for that question. Because of them I using this mobile against my will.***",

      "cust_review": "I bought this phone on first sale. It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it😊***Good phone. Fast delivery by amazon.Pros1 camera quality both selfie and back are awesome2.

Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it😊***Good phone. Fast delivery by amazon.Pros1 camera quality both selfie and back are awesome2. Battery back up is good3.Good buid quality4 finger print and face unlock both works smooth5 network connectivity and internet speed better than other phone like samsung MICons1 no fast charger take almost 2 hour to charge 100 percent2 no ear phone3 no fast charger4 no notification led***Camera is not as expected its like a 13 mp....

      "cust_review": "Well, I was a bit sceptical before buying this Samsung Galaxy M10, soI bought thisphone on the second sale & placed the order for the variant ie3GB+32GB for ₹8990. Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***",
