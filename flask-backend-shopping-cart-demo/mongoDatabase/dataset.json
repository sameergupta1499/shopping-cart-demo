  "cust_review": "Well, I was a bit sceptical before buying this Samsung Galaxy M10, soI bought thisphone on the second sale & placed the order for the variant ie3GB+32GB for \u20b98990. Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for \u20b97990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor \u20b98990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than \u20b99000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with \u20b99000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don\u2019t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***",

Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. \u20b96500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too.

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***\"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use..

The phone was a gift and it has received without the battery and headset, it is like they received a empty box without the main components. I have to spent another Rs. 499/- to buy a battery to save my face from the people whom I committed the gift. I never expected such a treatment from Amazon a reputed concern a treatment other portal like Flipkart does. I think now I will double think about Amazon before buying anything.With much regret.KURIAN DAVID***I came across issue on this phone in warranty period 1) Nokia customer support center suggest that this phone is no longer repaired but replaced hand to hand by seller 2) amazon deny any service 3 ) amazon ask for service denial letter from support center 4) support center dont give any letter ... find myself stuck unable to get warranty..... sucks !***Nice mobile phone provide nokia campany***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

  "cust_review": "I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE\u2014It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS\u20141) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons\u20141) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT\u2014If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent.

  "cust_review": "Well, I was a bit sceptical before buying this Samsung Galaxy M10, soI bought thisphone on the second sale & placed the order for the variant ie3GB+32GB for \u20b98990. Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for \u20b97990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor \u20b98990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than \u20b99000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with \u20b99000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don\u2019t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***",

  "cust_review": "I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE\u2014It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS\u20141) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons\u20141) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT\u2014If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent.

( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***",

  "cust_review": "Don't fall for the  negative reviews. This is best at the price. People following red mi phones but this has bigger advantage. I will write only advantages and cons and feedback Advantage-Amoled display.-Always on display (I compromised but it's there)-5000 Mah battery and runs 2 days.-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.-Wide angle camera is awsum.-No heating no lagging.-Face unlock is very fast.-Mainly look is stunning.....-Very low radiation-Blue light filter-Lock screen story and stunning pics.Cons-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.-Online availability.(Now in stock)-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?Feedbackfeedback-People say camera but I find it's too good.-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud  and clear enough.-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43After Using for 1 week-All well and amazing.-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule.***Last few months I am using this mobile performance wise not bad, if you download any file you can't find where it saved.Display -ok not full HD,Audio- LowSpeed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow. Earphone -not available.Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.***I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)***No EarPhone In Box And Mobile Cover Of Samsung M30.Samsung Provide Earphones in 2k Mobiles, But Here It's Missing. I Want To Return Samsung M30, Revert If It's Possible Now?***A Samsung's new launched M30 Smart phone is very cool because of the Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display is looking very nice. 13 MP ultra - wide dual camera & a triple camera setup capture which is clearly so cool with one of the best photography & great selfies. One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery & also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data. Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.Samsung M30 hasExynos 7904 Processor1.8 GHz Octa Core Processor & 4GB RAM - multitask gaming, videos, etc.***Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it***Phone is just fantastic but one problem in here.. does not work Google play or can't install or update any apps from Google play.. only just install from Samsung Galaxy app\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13***Liked-Battery backup (3days)Wide Camera featureSimple UI3 slots sim+mmcDisliked-SlipperyNO Pie updateonly single speaker at the bottom***",

  "cust_review": "Guys don't buy this model of Xiaomi, coz their is too many problem in this device also battery is drawing very very quick, I'm so frusted to spent 13000 worthless, pls go with Note 5 pro I think that phone  has commandable for battery life***This phone looks very nice1) photos in day light or good light is awesome2) selfie flash is not good, in dark you cant expect too much from front flash poor quality, rear flash does good job3) portrait mode is also awesome in daylight (both front with AI and rear with second camera) but in low light quality is poor, portrait mode doesn't supports flash.4) you gets 1.2GB free out of 3 GB and 22GB out of 32GB5) face unlock and fingerprint does good job6) screen size is awesome and screen quality (picture quality) is goodI got this phone at effective price of 7200/- and its awesome product for this price, overall photo quality is awesome in daylight and in good light but in low light quality reduces greatly.I am very happy with phone with effective price of 7200/-Dont buy its 4 GB Version other better products available at same cost  and buy only if you get on offer.***If you want to buy a good phone within 10000 I am suggesting you this phone best camera plus everything is good. Best thing no heating while playing PUBG \ud83d\ude02***Below are the issues1. When you join 3rd person on a call they won't listen when you talk (issue is with not with operator)2.Heating issue when on phone on a charge3.App Crash when you switch from one to another even with normal appsSo, I have been talking to so called Amazon Technical Team and trying my best to convince to refund my money, let's see how it goes..hope they read my review and respond soon..***Been using this phone since 3 months from now .. happy with the performance.Battery back up and pic quality is good.Only cons is that the face recognizion is a bit slow compared to other phones in market.....***=> DesignWell, Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body. Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

It's worst deal even at 6700/- below.it won't match 2018 standards.One more thing  you should know that why they are selling such long time ago launched product??? because they have stocks \ud83d\ude02.And some of them Have Serious Motherboard issue. which causes sudden motherboard loss anytime.Hope u will understand that it's not made for 2k18. so please don't buy it.Enjoy your Day!!! Happy shopping!!!***Bought this phone a lot ago. Just providing review after selling it second hand. This is an averange low end device. In this price range there are a lot of phones better than this.\u2022Build Quality- The build quality is average, nothing appreciatable.\u2022Camera Quality- Camera gives accurate color reproduction. That's good. But detailing is not up to the mark.\u2022Sound Quality- The sound quality is pretty better.\u2022Processor- The processor is not much powerful. Not for any kind of gaming. Heating issue comes on constant use of phone.\u2022Battery- The battery life is quite bad. It have a juice of one day only if you make calls or surf a little otherwise you have to charge twice the mobile.\u2022Price- In this price range I won't recommend it to buy. There are a lot more phones better than it in same price segment.\u2022Overall Performance-  The phone is an average phone. If you make calls only then you can buy it but strongly recommended not to buy. There are a lot mobiles in this price segment.***The phone is my second one. 1.5 years back I bought the same phone. Review after 1.5 years of the phone. Phone is sturdy, good sound and good overall general working. But recently problems when the charge falls below 50% with the internet on. I am here to point out that I don't use games. And I use only Whatsapp and Telegram apps.When charge goes below 50% it switches off and has to be connected to a charger to switch it on again.***It wont work after 2018. This phone has a 32 bit OS. It wont support apps after 2019 July. Wake up and know the facts. Amazon wont even allow u a refund or a replace with a different product.***Value for money i spent.***Never ever buy non flagship samsung phones for the following reasons:1 they always lag2 they are more expensive compare to the competators.3 the build quality is very poor.4 you find less featuresI had a bad experience and a good learning from this mistake. I recommend all to avoid wasting money in samsung budget phones.***Model is very nice. It's taking too much time for battery charging and also mobile is heating too much. Remaining all r ok***i bought it from amazon on July 2017. Till now no problem. its running smoothly. Network coverage is good. Never hang till now. Camera quality is superb. battery is strong enough for a day till now. thanks to amazon***",

  "cust_review": "I bought a 4 + 64 gb one. This phone is powered well with Kirin 659 and it's enough for a phone of this price segment.Pros:1] Looks- Decent2] Camera- Really wonderful3] Handling- A bit care would be recommended. Have some rough back covers.4] Performance- Okay to goodCons:1] Honor haven't yet released an Android Pie update and EMUI 9.0 for this phone particularly although it's expected in June-July this year.But overall, this is a beautiful phone, it's been a day or two yet I'd not doubt to count on this one. So, if you're willing to buy one of the best budget phones, here you go!***Camera clarity is good. I love this mobile. Good quality for its cost. But they not give me a headset.***Performance is as per the specs. You will know if you have already used high performance devices with 4gb ram with higher price tags.***Battery life was average...good picture quality.. But phone was getting heat..Continuous usage leads to over heating of mobile***A very bad phone with touchscreen problemI bought it before 10 days and suddenly the touch function is getting worse.i can\u2019t even type a single word properly.Please don\u2019t buy it.***Nice phone with light weight, good battery life. I gifted this to my mom n she is very happy....I think the camera is not that much good***Please do not buy this phone its not the worth you pay for, camera is crap because the pictures which are caputured look like they are  through VGA. Display is awkward.Please go for good brand rather spending on these things.***But out speaker sound and ear piece quality while making phone calls is low and not satisfactory.***",

  "cust_review": "I bought this phone on first sale. It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it\ud83d\ude0a***Good phone. Fast delivery by amazon.Pros1 camera quality both selfie and back are awesome2. Battery back up is good3.Good buid quality4 finger print and face unlock both works smooth5 network connectivity and internet speed better than other phone like samsung MICons1 no fast charger take almost 2 hour to charge 100 percent2 no ear phone3 no fast charger4 no notification led***Camera is not as expected its like a 13 mp....

  "cust_review": "If you are planning to buy this mobile, then read this & then decide it yourself.I bought Samsung m20 in first sale, using it from last 2 weeks.As samsung launched such mobile first time at this competitive price, expected many things.Pros:1. Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***",

  "cust_review": "I was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my son. I had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused \ud83d\ude15Finally I placed the order and bought it through Amazon.Believe me it fabulous product so far.The screen is apt and very clear.Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc.Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material. Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space.Phone is quite light weight and very smart.

You get a new device with current day trend of screen & camera, AI and looks, all with ok performace.Just some tweaks here and there & it will be good to go. P.S. Its not at all meant for gaming. Though cassual games will be ok.\u25b6 Already using 2 of 16 gb versions, my suggestion will be to get 32 gb internal, as sooner or later 16 gb runs out of space and you need to uninstall things to install others. Current apps n content consume a lot of space.\u25b6 Even after launch of Redmi 7 series, 6A is still in shelves for a reason. It offers quice decent feature set & performance in its price bracket. None of the current devices can beat its price point. Available frequently on sale for 500 less.\u25b6 BUT be open to other options available out there, you may shell out few bucks extra to avoid cons.***",

  "cust_review": "I bought this phone on first sale. It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it\ud83d\ude0a***Good phone.

  "cust_review": "I am going to step you through each aspect of the phone and my thoughts so far.Short VersionPro's- Good budget phone for any one India.- Battery life is shockingly good. (ha)- Phone feels amazing in the hand- Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break.- Speaker sounds not up to mark and even volume.- Design part I love it very muchCon's- Picture quality not good they given13 MP Rear camera | 5 MP front camera.- Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots.- Screen size is not 5.5 inch.- Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable.- Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection.- It doesn't make me breakfast.Overall, what Redmi phone does not everything but it\u2019s budget friendly phone.***Android Oreo 8 itself required 2GB RAM and consuming entire RAM. no memory for applications. Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now . Mi Fan***Redmi 6A not good as 5999 mrp veri slow working Totally waste of money product. Screen quality very poor, battery no good***",

  "cust_review": "Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.***Don't buy this MI 6 Pro ,Speaker volume is very bad & LowCamera pics are not good at all special back cam having dual cam stabilization problem front cam like VGA picsHeating issueBattrey drained very Fast***Cheap Chinese product.Negatives:1. Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5\" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. \u20b96500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***\"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***",

  "cust_review": "It is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5.

  "cust_review": "It is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro).

  "cust_review": "Wanted this for my mom. She wanted it primarily for calls. But the caller voice is distorting a lot. Very poor call quality. It's a very bad decision to buy this. Only reason to buy this is lowest sar value. But it's of no use if not for calls.Apps like YouTube and WhatsApp are not mandatory but preferred. So I'm regretting my decision.Verdict: it's good for lowest radition. So, if you're ok to use it for less calls, you can go for it. Otherwise, a strict NOUpdate: Have installed \"Phone Doctor Plus\" app and figured out that the faulty hardware is the reason for lack of clarity in the voice. On informing Amazon, they've asked to install another app and tested for themselves. On finding the fault, replaced a new phone. But new phone is also having same issue. Hence, they've refunded the money.If you are going to buy this, make sure to test it through \"Phone Doctor Plus\" app if it is passing all tests***There is no earphone in the box .

The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone.

  "cust_review": "Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.***Don't buy this MI 6 Pro ,Speaker volume is very bad & LowCamera pics are not good at all special back cam having dual cam stabilization problem front cam like VGA picsHeating issueBattrey drained very Fast***Cheap Chinese product.Negatives:1. Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5\" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. \u20b96500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***\"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***",

  "cust_review": "fell from very short height but completely damaged both front and back glass of phone. DO NOT Recommend this phone at all !! I have been using MOTo phones since 2013 now and this is my 3rd Moto phone but highly disappointed. Service Centre is charging me repair cost at more than the actual cost of this phone!! Pathetic.***Mobile is working fine. But after one week I noticed mobile is not charging and went to mobile shop and got cheked the Moto turbo charger and they said cable is not working, it's gone. I didn't expect this bad charger from Moto company. I have raised complaint to Amazon customer service to replace mobile charger they responded intially and they told they will call me back. But none of them called. I didn't expect bad service from Amazon.***Writing dis review after 2 months of usage...works fine\ud83d\ude0d...No lagging... Quite a good camera..Sound quality is amazing due to Dolby... Gives battery of almost 1 day...I think it is a perfect smart device.. Like it...\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d***This phone is just waste of money1. It's 4G network keeping dancing and comes to lowest signals, I tried with different sim cards and locations.After complaining to Moto customer care they asked to visit authorized service centre.And local service centre man said there no such problem with phome, instead he said it's 4G network always keep going low and high signal ,how is that possible.Actually this can be hardware problem.2 .Another problem I faced is it goes off randomly. Many times on phone calls . Suddnely it goes off and takes more than 5 minutes to start . That crazy when you are on some important call and lost conversation and then out of reach.3. BatteryHardly sustain for full day .There are better phone at this price .Just wasted buying such phone .Don't.regrett like me google about network problem of Moto g6 . There are many complains.Service centre will not help you .***I bought this smartphone 4 months ago,Camera is average, battery charges fastly, lowlight camera is not good, sometimes phone lags***I have been using Moto for past 4 years from Moto G2, then G5 and now G6. The G series have evolved very much. Coming to Moto G6.Touch Sensivity:Much improved and curved glass, makes the experience awesome. I prefer to use it, without tempered glass or screen guard, as we will miss the curved glass feel.Speed:No issues. 3GB version is sufficient for non gamers and regular useWeight:Light weight, with plastic back. Metal as in Moto G6 plus , may be bit heavierSound:Sound quality in headphone is excellent, with Dolby.Loud speaker volume is also decent. Ear piece volume should have been even better.Camera:Good at bright lightingsOther feature:C type USB - need migration if you use regular OTG pen driveAccessing power button is bit difficult. but one button navigation helpsHeadphone Jack 3.5mm at bottom, near USB port.Dedicated Memory card slot.I am very much satisfied with the product and looking to know what betterment can be made in next version. Bit challenging to Moto.***Moto G6 purchased on 13 June 2018 is dead by now. It's not responding at all. The phone had suddenly stopped working on 20 Dec 2018 (barely after 6 months), not powering on (with last remaining charge was ~95%). This happened while travelling, leaving disconnected with family & friends. Imagine if you were in a critical situation, I wish nobody should fall in such a situation at all..I don't know if it could be resolved by the motorola service center in Kolkata, despite being within warranty!Please people, don't buy Motorola now if really want to avoid this kind of situation. Their quality products (I used 3 earlier) are no more reliable. Never buy Chinese Motorola products (US motorola was far better as per my earlier experience with Moto devices)!***Before going to buy any product on Amazon every one should think twice due to Amazon's senseless policy. If you buy any product you can't assume the product quality, Right? I bought Moto G6 phone and I want to return that product because the body panel is not up to the mark. It is very delicate. Even camera is also not that much good. But when I tried to return this product they would not allow me. I asked them one question i.e., without seeing the product, how can I assume that is good or bad? But they don't have answer for that question. Because of them I using this mobile against my will.***",

Its like  i hv spent 53000 nd still i cant use a phone.***Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.I ordered it on 16th May 12PM and it got delivered by 17th May 10AMAnd so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. \ud83d\ude0d***No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

(ha)- Phone feels amazing in the hand- Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break.- Speaker sounds not up to mark and even volume.- Design part I love it very muchCon's- Picture quality not good they given13 MP Rear camera | 5 MP front camera.- Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots.- Screen size is not 5.5 inch.- Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable.- Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection.- It doesn't make me breakfast.Overall, what Redmi phone does not everything but it\u2019s budget friendly phone.***Android Oreo 8 itself required 2GB RAM and consuming entire RAM. no memory for applications. Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now . Mi Fan***Redmi 6A not good as 5999 mrp veri slow working Totally waste of money product. Screen quality very poor, battery no good***",

I will write only advantages and cons and feedback Advantage-Amoled display.-Always on display (I compromised but it's there)-5000 Mah battery and runs 2 days.-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.-Wide angle camera is awsum.-No heating no lagging.-Face unlock is very fast.-Mainly look is stunning.....-Very low radiation-Blue light filter-Lock screen story and stunning pics.Cons-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.-Online availability.(Now in stock)-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?Feedbackfeedback-People say camera but I find it's too good.-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud  and clear enough.-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43After Using for 1 week-All well and amazing.-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule.***Last few months I am using this mobile performance wise not bad, if you download any file you can't find where it saved.Display -ok not full HD,Audio- LowSpeed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow. Earphone -not available.Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.***I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)***No EarPhone In Box And Mobile Cover Of Samsung M30.Samsung Provide Earphones in 2k Mobiles, But Here It's Missing. I Want To Return Samsung M30, Revert If It's Possible Now?***A Samsung's new launched M30 Smart phone is very cool because of the Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display is looking very nice. 13 MP ultra - wide dual camera & a triple camera setup capture which is clearly so cool with one of the best photography & great selfies. One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery & also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data. Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.Samsung M30 hasExynos 7904 Processor1.8 GHz Octa Core Processor & 4GB RAM - multitask gaming, videos, etc.***Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it***Phone is just fantastic but one problem in here.. does not work Google play or can't install or update any apps from Google play.. only just install from Samsung Galaxy app\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13***Liked-Battery backup (3days)Wide Camera featureSimple UI3 slots sim+mmcDisliked-SlipperyNO Pie updateonly single speaker at the bottom***",

  "cust_review": "I bought this phone on first sale. It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it\ud83d\ude0a***Good phone. Fast delivery by amazon.Pros1 camera quality both selfie and back are awesome2.

  "cust_review": "I am writing this review to tell everyone not to buy this phone, today it stopped working which is about 2 months after purchase. Its not reliable.***I wish Amazon provide a negative rating. This piece would definitely receive a negative rating.The problem is that the dial pad has a mind on its own. It work sometimes, it doesn't work sometimes.Thanks to Amazon reliable return policy, it was returned and refunded.***lovely product.. sound is very loud.. i have kept it in my living room but can hear the ring in my bedroom as well that too very loud... very good product.. without a second thought you can buy this product....***Do not buy this phone. I used it for a while for apartment intercom. Bought it last Feb and it stopped working in like 7 months and I am stuck with a faulty product that didnt even last a year. Since it was a new phone I never had a hunch that it would stop working and thought the apartment security and personnel were being lazy not phoning anything in. This is absolutely not worth the price. Spend a bit more and get a better phone.***This phone is designed for use with mounting on the wall. The handset is locked onto the base of the phone so that the handset does not fall off the base when mounted on the wall. But due to this feature, if you use this phone as a table top phone, then at the time of lifting the handset, the base of the phone also gets lifted up and then falls down.***Plug and use ..sound ringer control  has been provide ( high or low two options) Hags well on the wall.***Excellent easy to use and simple phone. Dont expect the phone to do anything great other than taking and making a  few calls within the attached epabx system. Delivered on time and was super easy to install. Sound quality is good, build is decent and will solve the purpose of serving my need for a intercom***Product stopped working within 4 months. Trying to get in touch with Seller/Manufacturer... I hate all this.Update: This product has some unique problem. It works on single line without any issue but if you want to use as a parallel connection then it creates problem -  either you don't get dial tone or it stops dial tone of your parallel line/instrument. Very surprised. Finding it difficult to fix this issue.***",

Best thing no heating while playing PUBG \ud83d\ude02***Below are the issues1. When you join 3rd person on a call they won't listen when you talk (issue is with not with operator)2.Heating issue when on phone on a charge3.App Crash when you switch from one to another even with normal appsSo, I have been talking to so called Amazon Technical Team and trying my best to convince to refund my money, let's see how it goes..hope they read my review and respond soon..***Been using this phone since 3 months from now .. happy with the performance.Battery back up and pic quality is good.Only cons is that the face recognizion is a bit slow compared to other phones in market.....***=> DesignWell, Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body. Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

  "cust_review": "The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering \"mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money\". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime. In then situation, when there was good network in Samsung mobile, no network in redmi & lenovo A6000.This is the build quality of Chinese mobile.***",

  "cust_review": "Well, I was a bit sceptical before buying this Samsung Galaxy M10, soI bought thisphone on the second sale & placed the order for the variant ie3GB+32GB for \u20b98990. Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for \u20b97990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor \u20b98990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than \u20b99000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with \u20b99000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don\u2019t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***",

This phone is everything smartphone should not have:1) heating problem2) phone lag3) hopelessly low battery life4) very bad touch sensorAs a customer, I can accept every issue except heating problem which is a health hazard for a customer. There have already been multiple instances of exploding of Samsung phone in the past and overheated battery raises a concern.On top of everything, comes the service of Amazon. So much for the 10-day replacement policy in case of any issue. I have been contacting Amazon for more than 10 days about the issue and they have not been able to identify the issue. Their app is not available in the jurisdiction (sent a screenshot to them and there was no response). A technician visit is scheduled for after 5 days a technician visits and he has not been able to replicate the issue because he didn't have the time for a 30 min call which is when the phone gets heated up. Now it is the responsibility of the customer to install a temperature app, monitor the temperature and the raise the issue only if the temperature rises above 45 degrees Celcius. They seriously hope the user to hold a device at 45 degrees. They should revoke the policy of replacement if they don't want to support the claims of the customer. This will at the very least vanish any false hope that the customer would have while buying the product.***useless phone, don\u2019t buy this display camera is very bad 5k redmi phones are 1000 times better than this phone***PRODUCT IS OK***This is  a good phone than m20 because it has that amoled screen..

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

While typing it takes you back to home screen, may be some bugs.Weight is also on higher side.Phone is quite thick as well so no comparision with other premium modelsBest quality is battery life which can last upto 2 days with heavy usage.

I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.***1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product.***I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.***One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.***OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.***Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money.

  "cust_review": "Hi Everyone, it\u2019s my sincere suggestion NOT to buy this phone. I purchased this less than a month ago. Haven\u2019t installed any major 3rd party apps and still this phone is troubling me. It shuts down automatically and then it becomes a huge problem to restart this phone because everytime you restart it, it switches off again that very moment. At this very time when I am writing the review, the phone is not even restarting now. My money is wasted. This phone is not worth buying. Don\u2019t waste your hard earned money on this phone.***I am a fan of Moto G series mainly due to its durability and have been using it since its introduction. But Moto E5 Plus disappointed me badly. A minor drop on the floor resulted in a damaged screen within one month of purchase. The 5000mAh battery also started draining very quickly within the same period even with normal usage. There are a no of other brands available for the same price, so choose wisely.***Mobile has hang issue and front camera quality is bad and it hang during the phase change.i.e. from back to front camera. phone heats during the call and charging . I requested to amazon for return but they are denying for return.Only one option I have to go to consumer court.***Nice product.Good mobile Excellent.***Screen cracked automatically***Battery drain very quick,it didn't last even 5hrs but in the add its showing that 18hrs of playback time. Lol \ud83e\udd23....Other draw backs.1.Rapid charging ( just for attention only never mind) even it takes more than 6hrs to charge to get 100%*note when the phone is off.2.face detection wont work and about the finger print reader,may be work some times like oru indian govt. \ud83d\ude053.lock buttons & Volume buttons in wrong position.4.I bought this phone on 27th nov and returned back , The funny thing is it didn't even detect the sim card ,networks ,and even wifi .... Hihi***I've been using this mobile for more than a month now. It is very handy. I love big phones with good camera and this phone really suits my need. The storage capacity and the power of the battery makes it a best phone than the ones I've been using before.***Highly satisfied with its performance till date and its Battery Life***",

It is pretty good for gaming. It lasts well while playing PUBG, PES, Asphalt legends, etc. I play these games often.Sound quality is average.Overall a good phone for its price range.***So the thing is I've purchased this mobile a month ago and I'm more than satisfied to get the product at this price range . But alas it didn't last until the phones' touch screen stopped responding to the fingers and not working correctly from the past week. Called service centre and their cell's been switched off and no response from them so far . So to sum it up , great product in the features and all but really poor in it's durability.***I just love this phone. Worth buying. Picture quality is too good.

The Video is too shaky even if the hands are steady.2)WIFI : The wifi chip is too weak and disconnects at low signals and has a poor download and upload speed.3)Selfie Flash is not too bright and the auto mode in selfie light does not work properlyMy Samsung j5 prime keeps the lowest signal connected.***Purchased this product total waste of your money ..within 10 days Continuously restart issue.service centre not able to find solution..after complaint tollfree they are not ready to replace New.they simply convey to wait 10 days for board replacement..not at all satisfy this product as they mention spec and quality also..***+ Really good phone under 10K range.+ Camera performance is also impressive and much better then other competitive phones.+ Total Package.***Honor 7c is one of the handsets that fits the price range and truly justifies for what you payFront camera is good for selfiesBack camera is good but as I am I phone user surely the pic quality does not match to that levelSound is very good you can enjoy movies on the goWatching movies on this large screen is really awsmeBattery life is too good as I phone lacks in battery life.

It's hanging a lot in phone application. I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus.

But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. \ud83d\ude0d***No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.***",

  "cust_review": "Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***",

I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

One in the bottom is loud  and clear enough.-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43After Using for 1 week-All well and amazing.-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule.***Last few months I am using this mobile performance wise not bad, if you download any file you can't find where it saved.Display -ok not full HD,Audio- LowSpeed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow. Earphone -not available.Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.***I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)***No EarPhone In Box And Mobile Cover Of Samsung M30.Samsung Provide Earphones in 2k Mobiles, But Here It's Missing.

The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone.

  "cust_review": "If you are planning to buy this mobile, then read this & then decide it yourself.I bought Samsung m20 in first sale, using it from last 2 weeks.As samsung launched such mobile first time at this competitive price, expected many things.Pros:1. Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***",

  "cust_review": "I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.I have one issue with phone :My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...***First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone. Nice colour and Design. 6.5 inch screen makes a great viewing experience for movies and game's specialy PUBG\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. Super fast Charging. Full Charge in just 1.5 Hrs. But memory need to be 128 GB for this price range.Camera quality is superb.***Good mobile very nice thank you oppoI am Full happy dis moble camera v v v good super  super***I didnt got free bluetooth speaker and selfie stick what is this***1 Week use Detailed ReviewNo problem on the phone yetPros-Back Camera,Night mode,Slo-Mo,Video, Portrait Mode,etc are excellentFront Camera is perfectThe pop-up design is awesome and eye catchingThe color(Aurora Green) is extremely beautiful and attractiveThe battery life is amazing and VOOC 3.0 Is superbDoes not get heated up even after an extreme useMediatek Helio P70 is perfect and fastOverall A perfect PhoneCons-Plastic BackFront Portrait fades away sometimeInternal memory should have been 128gb at this price segment or there should have been a dedicated slot for memory cardOverall if you can avoid all this cons(I think this Cons wont make a much difference)Oppo F11 Pro is perfect for you Go for Itt***I have been using this phone for last one week and am very satisfied with this deal. Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***",

It gets stuck when you forward or remind the videoI don't understand how these guys release phones without doing basic testing.***I was exicted to see honor 8c at this price point 11999 with good battery hd+ screen and 13mp camera. It has very good power management and the battery lasts easily for over 2 daysBut i was shocked to see the really bad quality of the display and camera. Phones in the price range of 7k have better pictures and screen quality with the battery. Really bad product from Honor. They should take this device off the shelves or sell it for 7999 with mentioning the camera as 5mp. Yes the camera is definitely 13mp on paper but the output is very bad. I thought it was just because of the screen but when i check the pics on my laptop they look even worse.I am returning the device thankfully amazon did agree to it. I have used honor 9lite and it was fantastic device at 9999. But this Honor is utter crap.***Camera \ud83d\udcf8 quality 10/9Battery \ud83d\udd0b life 10/10Screen quality 10/9***Not worth for moneyPoor camera clarity ( front & rear)Poor display quality.Sound ok.Don't buy***Worst mobile camera quality is very bad its like low mgp***",

Phone went through the entire washing process and is working just fine after drying!!! Hats off to the designers. Do I need to mention anymore about the durability.. ha ...haOnly one problem which I felt from day one was the charging pin type is proprietary. Normally all phones available today are usb type however you will have to carry this charger everywhere you go. Otherwise, Voice quality and audio is all good. Battery life is generally 3 days.***Vexed with smart phones,want peace of mind, very attractive,tiny, light weight and fantastic battery backup.***Back cover is loose. Otherwise supebbb phone.***It is very useful for the people who want to buy in low budget and want good quality .***Sound quality is Resenable. Battery life is great (4-5) days. It is durable.***My father is simple person, he never using any modern gadgets, so he always requesting a simple phone, so he we changed many phones at last we found something better simple phone, but this Samsung Guru 1200 has some mic or speaker problems because of this is our second Samsung Guru 1200, the first one was gote some hearing problem at both the sides, and this phone is also getting a little hearing problem now, so I think it is time to order third Samsung Guru 1200, haha, but we will change product when we will found better phone than this product, Thanks***Very nice basic phone. First one, I bought 2.5 years ago for my 60 yr old mother. That one was working well but few days ago my mother accidentally dropped the phone in bucket full of water. That one could not be repaired. That was human error, otherwise phone is superb for old people. I have just bought new one for her.***",

No haptic effect(vibration) when you press the soft key in the bottom of the phone.2.OTG issue resolved (connect the OTG cord to the phone and wait for the notification,then connect the pendrive to the cord,then wait for a while a notification  would pop on the display and you can also access the same in my files.)Hope Samsung solves the above issue...!!!***Not a good purchase at the price point,lags a lot and there is no app lock in the phone.

  "cust_review": "Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

  "cust_review": "A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide \"Double Tap\" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is \"unnis-bees ka farak\" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1.

  "cust_review": "I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.I have one issue with phone :My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...***First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***",

Body of phone isn't good its average.Battery backup is good and talking quality perfect.***I have been dealing with Amazon for the last five years and for the first time I got a set back from you. The phone was a gift and it has received without the battery and headset, it is like they received a empty box without the main components. I have to spent another Rs. 499/- to buy a battery to save my face from the people whom I committed the gift. I never expected such a treatment from Amazon a reputed concern a treatment other portal like Flipkart does. I think now I will double think about Amazon before buying anything.With much regret.KURIAN DAVID***I came across issue on this phone in warranty period 1) Nokia customer support center suggest that this phone is no longer repaired but replaced hand to hand by seller 2) amazon deny any service 3 ) amazon ask for service denial letter from support center 4) support center dont give any letter ... find myself stuck unable to get warranty..... sucks !***Nice mobile phone provide nokia campany***",

Also, the stickers on the box like - product details, VoLte, manufacturer details are manually and poorly stuck.The protective shield on the phone was improperly stuck, has air bubble below the shield and had fine finger print marks over it.

Look seems pretty i bought red in color and it look elegant. it seems like premium smartphone.2. when we start the phone it takes minimum time to start. it feels like butter3. initially the processor works good when there are factory applications installed in it.4. Screen touch is bitter less responsive but it is better for this budget.5. Color OS is producing good built up for apps but color response of screen is bitter annoying when use for longtime e.g.  gaming or watching movies6. rear 13+2 MP camera working nicely in day and pretty light condition. in low light photos are somwhat blurry ...but for this budget this camera setup is outstanding, and suffice the purpose. front 8 MP camera is good for daytime selfies and screen flash is also working good.7. Face unlock is very fast and responsive and working well in low light.8, battery is long lasting but takes 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. this is the only con of this that this does not have fast charging mode but again nothing could be better than this phone.9. speaker sound is impressive10, dual sim mode working fine.Now the small glimpse of cons- 1. battery charging time is longer about 3 to 4 hrs for full charge from nil battery.2. OS coloring is not that much good. i think OS upgrade will short out this problem.except everything is outstanding...you can go for this phone without a hassle if your budget is within 9k, No other phone can beat this phone in this budget.***",

Good 4000mAh battery.(lasts whole day with 4g internet)2. Good calling.(earpiece volume is loud and clear)3. 5.5\" display is big enough for videos.4. Good value for money phone.Cons:1. low RAM.(1GB RAM is simply not enough. almost 70% is already used by system.)2. low storage. (8GB is not enough. Highly recommends for a separate sd-card with this phone.)> camera is good enough for the price.> build quality and looks are also good for the price.> usb OTG works.> system monitor apps shows only 871 MB RAM.(attached a screenshot.)This is a very good phone for parents and individuals who are not into many apps and uses phone for basic functionalities.***I have bought this phone in exchange of Redmi Note 4. I was bugged by the Ads and bloatware in Redmi Note 4.This Nokia 2.1 phone has no bloatware, but it does have a Nokia app which can't be disabled or removed.Everything works great, except for one big problem. The Wifi signal strength is very weak. I can't access Wifi in some parts of the house where all other devices have no problem accessing Wifi.I have seen other users complaining about this on XDA forum. I hope that a software update might fix this. Will update the review if that happens.***I bought this phone for my grandfather, who was using a Nokia feature phone till now.I wanted a phone with large display (at least 5.5\"), good battery life, and simple UI. This phone delivers on all fronts.Battery life is excellent with the 4Ah capacity.RAM is only 1 GB, but that's okay. the user won't be doing that much multitasking :-).Stock Android is simple and easy to learn for first-time users. I think a phone with a custom UI like Xiaomi's MIUI or any Oppo/Vivo phone would be difficult, because of the amount of options and features available.There is a launcher in Play Store made specifically for senior citizen called \"BIG Launcher\". It is a paid app, but you can use the free trial to see if it works for you.Comes with 8.1 Go edition. The Go edition is Android optimized for phones with less RAM. Nokia has a good reputation when it comes to software updates, so I expect this phone to get regular updates and security patches.It has dual front-facing speakers. Once again, good for extra loudness.Nowadays, Android has support for most major Indian languages, so that's also a plus.I also considered the Moto E5 Plus, but decided this was good enough. Also, some reviews said the E5 Plus was a bit on the heavier side due to the 5Ah battery.***This is really bad mobile. Within 15 days its display not working. And touch also not that good. Don't buy this phone.***With dual front firing speakers, large 4000 mAh battery and a large 5.5\" 720p IPS screen, and its a Nokia, means that this is a great phone to buy.What could be a turn off is the small internal memory and RAM, but if you are not a heavy user then Android Go works fine here.I was initially going for Samsung J2 Core but a smaller battery and smaller display, that too a 540p, was the reason I didn't buy that one.***All about phone is good but one major blunder.Display gets off and the phone becomes unusable during a call. You can do nothing with the phone when on call. You cant even check contact list or type a note. Nothing. I didn't find this issue with a colleague who uses this same phone. I was either handed over a defective piece or Nokia is no more the TRUSTWORTHY Nokia.***Very slow and at this price company like Nokia should atleast give 2 to 3gb of RAM. My dad uses this device just for making phone calls and if he starts using Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or any other apps then this phone will surely lag.***Hi ,Two Nokia 2.1 handsets that I ordered have manufacturing defects.1. After accepting the call, if during the ongoing call session, tries to open different apps like contact list or Message app, the handset screen turns blank. Handset does not support multi-tasking. Malfunctions.2.  On handset charging stage, the charging status light does not show charged status.3.  Voice quality is poor.***",

  "cust_review": "It is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5. Affordable as compared to Pro Version6. Amoled Full HD7.Snapdragon 855 SoC***It is so buttery smooth and insanely fast that i don't have words to describe whole experience... Just buy it you won't regret... Its better than OnePlus 7 Pro.***it is getting heated and screen is blinking non stop***Phone stopped working after 2 days. Not switching on. Please don't buy. Also not able to return.***Oneplus, as always packs the pure raw power in their devices. Its slick, fast, smooth and much improved entertainment box now. It has stereo speakers but sadly no aux, along with that the saddest part is, there is no type c to aux dongle. Deducted two stars because of same charging speed as last year and aux missing.****Honest Review*Bought Oneplus 7 in the first sale.Delivered 2 days backUsing OnePlus for the first time. It is  just superb.Not easy to describe OnePlus 7 in a small review.Camera is fantastic.This is the first phone which is faster then the speed of my fingers :p33,000 is a handsome amount but i think this phone is value for money.If you are one who spend his good time using phone then this is best for you. Its processor saves time because now i am able to do work even more faster.Features you can easily check in product description.5/5 for camera.5/5 for processor.5/5 for shape.5/5 overall.***Well, much awaited OnePlus really stood up the wait we all did.I won't go for the pros and cons! I will go with the feel this phone has which it's competitors such as Asus, Redmi, etc doesn't at all.Yes, there are some quirks but still this is valuable smartphone your hard earned money can really buy.Your money will be on the right side with this OnePlus 7, if you're in doubt which phone to buy in 35k budget.. go with this one hands down, eyes closed. This will you that premium feel.Clean crisp display, loud stereo speakers, super fast phone, nicer camera, fastest storage, etc.Pro tip: Install GCam for OnePlus 7 and click pictures as good as pixel phones. Trust me. You'll love your OnePlus more for this. It will significantly improve your phone's camera quality at par with flagships costing 60k.***",

  "cust_review": "hi nice mobile nice camera everything Perfact i love vivo***Fastest delivery by amazon. Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after \"is\" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

  "cust_review": "Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.***Don't buy this MI 6 Pro ,Speaker volume is very bad & LowCamera pics are not good at all special back cam having dual cam stabilization problem front cam like VGA picsHeating issueBattrey drained very Fast***Cheap Chinese product.Negatives:1. Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5\" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. \u20b96500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***\"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***",

  "cust_review": "A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide \"Double Tap\" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is \"unnis-bees ka farak\" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

  "cust_review": "I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.I have one issue with phone :My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...***First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

But memory need to be 128 GB for this price range.Camera quality is superb.***Good mobile very nice thank you oppoI am Full happy dis moble camera v v v good super  super***I didnt got free bluetooth speaker and selfie stick what is this***1 Week use Detailed ReviewNo problem on the phone yetPros-Back Camera,Night mode,Slo-Mo,Video, Portrait Mode,etc are excellentFront Camera is perfectThe pop-up design is awesome and eye catchingThe color(Aurora Green) is extremely beautiful and attractiveThe battery life is amazing and VOOC 3.0 Is superbDoes not get heated up even after an extreme useMediatek Helio P70 is perfect and fastOverall A perfect PhoneCons-Plastic BackFront Portrait fades away sometimeInternal memory should have been 128gb at this price segment or there should have been a dedicated slot for memory cardOverall if you can avoid all this cons(I think this Cons wont make a much difference)Oppo F11 Pro is perfect for you Go for Itt***I have been using this phone for last one week and am very satisfied with this deal. Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***",

Bought it looking at the triple camera but it seems it is for display only. The camera is worst and takes you back to the phones 10 year old. No image stabilization, no clarity, no zoom. Camera is essential part of phones today and this phone is a waste with such a bad camera. I faced some issues with keyboard and typing as well. While typing it takes you back to home screen, may be some bugs.Weight is also on higher side.Phone is quite thick as well so no comparision with other premium modelsBest quality is battery life which can last upto 2 days with heavy usage. But no point buying a phone just for battery life with other features so bad.***Wow...!!***",

I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.***1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product.***I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.***One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.***OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.***Good build.amazing battery life.

  "cust_review": "hi nice mobile nice camera everything Perfact i love vivo***Fastest delivery by amazon. Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after \"is\" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund..

It has very good power management and the battery lasts easily for over 2 daysBut i was shocked to see the really bad quality of the display and camera. Phones in the price range of 7k have better pictures and screen quality with the battery. Really bad product from Honor. They should take this device off the shelves or sell it for 7999 with mentioning the camera as 5mp. Yes the camera is definitely 13mp on paper but the output is very bad. I thought it was just because of the screen but when i check the pics on my laptop they look even worse.I am returning the device thankfully amazon did agree to it. I have used honor 9lite and it was fantastic device at 9999.

This phone is everything smartphone should not have:1) heating problem2) phone lag3) hopelessly low battery life4) very bad touch sensorAs a customer, I can accept every issue except heating problem which is a health hazard for a customer. There have already been multiple instances of exploding of Samsung phone in the past and overheated battery raises a concern.On top of everything, comes the service of Amazon. So much for the 10-day replacement policy in case of any issue. I have been contacting Amazon for more than 10 days about the issue and they have not been able to identify the issue. Their app is not available in the jurisdiction (sent a screenshot to them and there was no response). A technician visit is scheduled for after 5 days a technician visits and he has not been able to replicate the issue because he didn't have the time for a 30 min call which is when the phone gets heated up. Now it is the responsibility of the customer to install a temperature app, monitor the temperature and the raise the issue only if the temperature rises above 45 degrees Celcius. They seriously hope the user to hold a device at 45 degrees. They should revoke the policy of replacement if they don't want to support the claims of the customer. This will at the very least vanish any false hope that the customer would have while buying the product.***useless phone, don\u2019t buy this display camera is very bad 5k redmi phones are 1000 times better than this phone***PRODUCT IS OK***This is  a good phone than m20 because it has that amoled screen..

  "cust_review": "Bang for buck. Not even hanged single time, using it as primary device since my miA2 was stolen.Definitely I miss camera but battery life is Insane. I get around 5-6 hours of screen on time.Smooth UI ,no bloats or ad business going on.Sound quality is good and also signal reception.I have used Redmi 4a and 5a but I prefer this over those because of stock android like UI and essential phone type work.***Very good product I like it***First of all thanks to amazon and the courier boy is also worth mentioning that he had patience and was good bcoz I took some more time to complete payment... Now coming to the productNice in budget smartphones... What I liked is good battery with fast charging, nice front camera for video call, rear camera is fine, included back cover and screen protector in box also earphones means not required to purchase extra things, android go means will be providing update for 2 years... Speaker also good, one more thing which I like is gestures like double tap wake up and when screen is off and you make 'V' its flash is lit...Only the main negative point is ram is 1gb that doesn't allow to run two apps simultaneously... I also would have preferred 2gb variant but when I purchased, its 2gb variant was not released in market...Overall well and good...Today when the representative took feedback on call and asked about rating, I told that will give 4 stars for which he didn't convinced for more and only replied to write a review... But since rating matters I am giving 5 stars.***Quality is superb. Speaker, battery,picture and all other features are good. I love it. This is best product under 6000. Satisfied.***I ordered it on 15th August and it come today. First impression phone was looking good. after spend some  time camera is ok for this price. daylight photo come really nice. But the portrait shots are not good. I bought this for my mom she is happy with it.***Speaker stopped working after 17 days. Mobile gets switched off automaticaally. Amazon has return policy of 10 days. It worked perfectly for 15 days and speker stopped working from 16 days. God knows what all will stop working as time pass by. Ridiculous. Dont buy lava phone.***Very bad product by lava battery life is very poor and front speaker sounds very bad***Well, the first impression looks good and the product delivers on almost all fronts as promised. So it would be so far so good situation, however it would be too early too praise or criticize, let us give it few weeks before a complete performance review and rating. For now, it looks 'Value for Money' with this price tag! Way to go...***",

  "cust_review": "If you are looking for Nokia brand and just feature phone and i would certainly recommend it.This basic phone will be very useful for people who wants to listen to songs and capture some images (of course it is just 0.3 MP camera). It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).***Best basic mobile with front camera and front flash, and good battery life in this price, and mobile is easy to use, but I feel sound is low compared to other mobiles..***It\u2019s a gift for my mom, as she is not tech savvy and is not into smart phones. This phone is perfect for normal use and is very light and cute one!***Very good phone with very good quality Loudspeaker & mic & earpiece quality with strong standard from Nokia!Buy it!***The sound quality is bad to say the least.  When I called Nokia Customer care they promised to replace the piece and assured of pick up in 24-48 hours.  gave me a complaint no. I have also sent a mail to their customer care.  Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *. Now it is totally confusing to lock keypad. Battery backup would have been little more, still it last lasts for 2 days with Avg. Calling and playing music files***",

  "cust_review": "A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide \"Double Tap\" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is \"unnis-bees ka farak\" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

  "cust_review": "Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***",

  "cust_review": "Was glad to see made in India label inside the phone. But when I saw the charger it said \"made in china\". Still OK. Now I thought of charging the phone a bit.. just 5 minutes after setting the new phone. As soon as I connected the charger to the socket, there was a spark and shot circuit in the charger, phone was not connected. So go disappointed. I am not returning this phone as I have already gifted it. Not sure if Amazon seller would be able to send replacement for the charger alone. Amazon never replaced the product even after multiple conversations..***The phone at first look is an ice breaker at this price ...during the first year everything related to it I'm pressed me weather it is sound quality or features.....but as the first year ended the story took a horrible turn. My phone has now a lot of issues , it's charging speed has slowed down, it didn't charge at once,I have to reinsert the charging pin while charging as it stops charging after some times, it comes out of sleep after pressing the side button a lot of times,and even when I press the side key to lock it ,it makes an emergency number call automatically......etc....etc....And now it has revealed it's face after 1yr so I can't avail for warranty replacement.***Amazing Smartphone under 10k, Camera is mind blowing.Everything are working well.No Issues \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c***Highly NOT RECOMMENDEDWhile ordering I was like I'm ordering Indian make handset with patriotic feeling and expected the unexpected :(Pathetic phone, received defected peice, got it exchanged after so much hassle, again received faulty handset. If someone calls me other person can't hear me properly. They think I've put the on speaker and speaking from other room with phone in other room. So awful.***Whatever this phone might have been capable of has been completely ruined by the software on this phone and despite almost everybody calling it out to micromax, there is no hint of any improvement regarding the same.After almost an year using this phone, I would not recommend this or any other micromax phone for that matter. To what extent do we settle with this company for the sake of patriotism, atleast the Chinese are working hard and competing with apple, and here is micromax only interested in churning in money by reselling the fruit of Chinese hardwork. Great example of pathetic leadership and certainly not a company that shows any patriotism or deserves the patriotic support shown by Indians towards this company !***This is a really worst phone .This phone is arise ao many software problems .Like hanging,slow working apps..Touch will be loose with in a short period of time ..And lack of servicing centers ...Even small crash on phone also this phone unworthy for warranty ... Software update kavalante 300/-.at services centre.,such a big mistake in my daily usage..So plz beware of this phone***Better than Redmi Note 4... Using this phone since last 6 months..no problem at all.. Everything is good in this phone under the price range 10k... A better try from Micromax to get back into the market...***Got this phone delivered on 15th aug, using it for more than 15 hours now. Facing problem with battery drainage, it reduces like 20% with normal usage in less than an hour. By normal usage I mean even updating the contact details as it is new phone. Also when the phone is not in use i.e on standby it reduces 5-7% in an hours time.So 20% drainage in 1hr is really bad. Hence applying for Return.***",

  "cust_review": "Wanted this for my mom. She wanted it primarily for calls. But the caller voice is distorting a lot. Very poor call quality. It's a very bad decision to buy this. Only reason to buy this is lowest sar value. But it's of no use if not for calls.Apps like YouTube and WhatsApp are not mandatory but preferred. So I'm regretting my decision.Verdict: it's good for lowest radition. So, if you're ok to use it for less calls, you can go for it. Otherwise, a strict NOUpdate: Have installed \"Phone Doctor Plus\" app and figured out that the faulty hardware is the reason for lack of clarity in the voice. On informing Amazon, they've asked to install another app and tested for themselves. On finding the fault, replaced a new phone. But new phone is also having same issue. Hence, they've refunded the money.If you are going to buy this, make sure to test it through \"Phone Doctor Plus\" app if it is passing all tests***There is no earphone in the box .

  "cust_review": "Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***",

Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. \u20b96500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***\"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***",

  "cust_review": "I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.I have one issue with phone :My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...***First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone. Nice colour and Design. 6.5 inch screen makes a great viewing experience for movies and game's specialy PUBG\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. Super fast Charging. Full Charge in just 1.5 Hrs. But memory need to be 128 GB for this price range.Camera quality is superb.***Good mobile very nice thank you oppoI am Full happy dis moble camera v v v good super  super***I didnt got free bluetooth speaker and selfie stick what is this***1 Week use Detailed ReviewNo problem on the phone yetPros-Back Camera,Night mode,Slo-Mo,Video, Portrait Mode,etc are excellentFront Camera is perfectThe pop-up design is awesome and eye catchingThe color(Aurora Green) is extremely beautiful and attractiveThe battery life is amazing and VOOC 3.0 Is superbDoes not get heated up even after an extreme useMediatek Helio P70 is perfect and fastOverall A perfect PhoneCons-Plastic BackFront Portrait fades away sometimeInternal memory should have been 128gb at this price segment or there should have been a dedicated slot for memory cardOverall if you can avoid all this cons(I think this Cons wont make a much difference)Oppo F11 Pro is perfect for you Go for Itt***I have been using this phone for last one week and am very satisfied with this deal. Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***",

  "cust_review": "I never had any opinion about VIVO and OPPO. After a discussion with my friend, I checked V11 Pro over POCO F1 as I'm an ardent Xiaomi Fan. The specs were amazing except the processor. However V11 pro handles the apps like a charm. I play Asphalt 9 often and the performance is always great.  Camera is decent. It makes me look too white and you never get the natural look. Selfie lovers are taken care of with several features and 25MP front camera.Low light capabilities are worst and the processing algorithm works worst  under few conditions. When digital zoomed, it smudge the faces and it was too worst in back lit conditions. HDR works decent.  Phone feels very light in hand and moving from 5.5 inch display to this I didn't have any issues. I love this display, however the display is on the warmer side and I had to change it in settings and I still feel it is warmer.  Regarding the software, the Funtouch OS is overdone and the updates are very rare. I am not sure about the update support in the future and update to Android 9. Few issues like, when you switch on wifi in the control centre,it goes to the WIFI settings everytime, the same applies to bluetooth. It is irritating when using other apps. Multitasking works only with very few apps.  Dedicated Game mode is amazing. Search feature in the settings is not there which is disappointing.  The only downside of the mobile is the Operating System.  Quick charge is amazing and it charges the 3400mAh battery in around 90 to 100 minutes. It easily stands for a day with moderate usage. Heavy usage may take you around 8 to 9 hours to dry the battery.  Amazing piece of hardware with Super AMOLED display which looks great and the display is almost bezel-less.The graphics around the fingerprint scanner is amazing.Face ID works better and in display fingerprint scanner is sometimes a hit or miss. I rely much on the Face ID which works even in darker conditions.  Package has an earphone which is a nice touch comparing other brands who don't care about that.  I would definitely recommend this mobile.Hits :  Amazing Display  Face ID  PerformanceMiss:  Terrible Operating System  Fingerprint scannerI would recommend this phone for the price especially for the display.***I never liked Vivo or Oppo. I was always a fan of Xiomi. Vivo V11 Pro was not my first choice. I wanted to buy Real Me 2 Pro. With all offers this phone was around 18K same price as 8GB, 128 GB model of Real me Pro. I just hated the flash sales.My requirement was  Good Screen, Nice Photos, Music and I do not care much about playing games.My experiences after using 10 daysPros:-1.Superb display it is a treat to watch the screen. Nearly Bezel Less and the water drop notch you would hardly notice while watching videos.2.Camera Performance is good, but in an effort to make me look white it over smudges in portrait shots other wise camera performance is decent on Front and Back3.Super light weight, slips from hand easily.4. I do not play games for me battery lasts almost whole day, but the charge is super fast, almost 1 to 2 percentage for every minute. So even I am in low battery, it charges in no time.5. Face unlock is super fast even at night and in dark. You will never use finger print scanner.Cons:-1. I always used stock android or MIUI. Funtouch OS is a mess, but since we do not do any setting changes regularly, it is ok.2. Updates are hopeless, this is October, but still phone runs on August Security Patch. I would recommend this phone only if you are getting it for around 18K or less else it is not worth it.***Worst part about the phone1. Funtouch version of Android- compulsory u have to use funtouch. U can. Not  switch to pure Android launcher- u can not arrange the apps alphabetically.- the easy access button has limited use- basic pull down quick access not availableDon't buy if u have been using this phone***Purchased with Good Hopes, But..1.Screen lock is not working, If you keep Finger for 4-5 second Screen will unlock By Luck2. Call Drop is Common Problem, Anytime during call Call Sensor stopped working.3.Face Unlock is Difficult to Open, Always you have to Draw pattern For Unlocking Device5.Phone Starts Hanging6.Picture Quality is So So, You cant compare this Device with One Plus any series. Previously i was Oneplus3 user. I am feeling Bad ,why i decided to purchase this by exchanging my Op36. \"Battery\" Dash Charging Is Only the Tag line to Sell device. It will take around 1.50-2.30 hour to charge device.7.Phone Heating is Normal Problem.8.Screen and Back Cover Catch dirt and finger prints. You have to keep one Tissue always for wiping the Dirt.9.Sound Quality is Good, Video Quality is Good10.Call voice is Ok Ok.. Not so Clear, Background Noice Is more disturbing.\"Purchase this Device at Your Own Risk\"Because Resell Value is Tooo Low.***Picture quality as u can see awesome!!!!***Unboxed found new handset, started phone and its getting hang, restarting, not starting , really upset . Can\u2019t use the phone . First time shifted to android and was really upset to see a new phone having problem. Requested for replacement/ refund . Amazon mentioned technician will rectify issue and let me know till than I have to wait. Better to buy offline use. Waste of moneyI brought this phone after all positive reviews here and sad that I am giving one star because of its poor performance/ actually no performing all***I WAS USING I PHONES FROM LAST 7 YEARS. I WAS NOT AT ALL ATTRACTED IN ANY ANDROID PHONE IN LAST 7 YEARS, BUT AFTER 7 YEARS I HAVE DECIDED TO GO FOR ANDROID AGAIN. AND MARK MY WORDS THIS VIVO V11 PRO IS AMAZING, SUPERB, MIND BLOWING CELL PHONE. SCREEN IS SO GOOD AND VIBRANT, BATTERY LIFE IS TOO GOOD AND THE BEST PART IS CAMERA SPECIALLY FRONT CAMERA WHICH IS 25MP IS THE BEST FRONT FACING CAMERA I HAVE EVER SEEN. SO DONT HASITATE BUY THIS PHONE.***",

Just loved the rear cams' dazzle modeClose yourbeyes and go for Oppo F11***Great phone .. got it for 11k with exchange .. fantastic camera, great sound and no heating problem at all after playing game for 1hour also .. Fast charging and lasts whole day .. One star less for the earphones.. getting pain after just 10 mins of usage .. oppo could have provided buds .. disappointed with the earphones provided ..rest all top notch features***Review after 48 hours.  PROS-premium look and feel,mind blowing cameras especially low light(both),vibrant screen for video and gaming,powerful processor,storage(105 gb free),smooth fingerprint sensor+faceunlock,butter touch screen,battery back up(>24 hrs+no heating),fast charging(50 min),colors os(no ads and spam),in the box-vooc charger+headphone+screen guard+backcover  CONS-Not so noticeable but still lacks selfie shutter in fingerprint sensor, slightly overpriced..I found it better than Redmi note 7pro(better camera,better os,better design and built,all in one box package and no irritating flash sale !! )..it is something new and fresh in market.I personally loved marble green colour.  PS-Thanks to the Amazon and seller(Appario RPL)for hassle free exchange(with 2000 bucks bonus) and delivery.***",

As a basic phone I was expecting more but then Ok. Battery last for almost two days if fully charged but only when you use it for calls. If you use FM then it doesn't even last for few hours. And my set has problem of lagging. I wan't expecting something like this from a basic phone. When I disconnect the call the screen gets still and I can't use it further so I have to restart it. It has happened like 3-4 times in past few days. Voice quality and FM is good. It is handy and keypad is comfortable.***Amazing color***Mobile was two good but i find  blutooth in fuction***Very sturdy and easy to use for senior citizens. It fell down a couple of times due to the shaking hands and it survived the impacts so far...***SOUND BETTER THAN OTHERS***Stopped working in barely 2 months, customer service is so bad that they are asking to spend rs. 1000 for repairing even under warranty only a stupid person will spend 1000 rs on rs. 1400 phone***",

  "cust_review": "A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide \"Double Tap\" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is \"unnis-bees ka farak\" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2. The excellent battery even with heavy games3. Games are running quite good specially PubGNot Recommended***i was use of mi phone before a long time...but one day my friend suggested me that use of Samsung device...so i will try it and purchased Samsung Galaxy A50... really guys it's a very excellent phone...\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc97 it's display was best as other devices....best picture quality capture by this phone.... thank you for best price segment mobile phone provided by Samsung.... also my friend hiren Patel....who suggested me for this device \ud83d\udc4c\u270c\ud83d\udc4d***Unbelievable product from Samsung, much confident now , with new interface like , one  UI, in display fingerprint sensor etc***Device heat too much during audio call or video call***",

  "cust_review": "After using a smartphone for a little too many days and being stuck in constant distractions, I've traded in my smartphone for this dumb phone, and I've been so happy with this decision. The OS is simple and lag free, basic functions like the camera and music player work as expected. The music player is a little too bare-bones for my liking but it's still passable at this price. Call quality is good, battery life is pretty good as well, and it recognises 4G sim cards albeit it doesn't really support 4G call quality or even the internet!Overall this phone is great for minimalists, the elderly, or really anyone looking for a digital detox.***I bought if for my father and from next day on wards it is automatically switching off in every 4-5 minutes. He could not use it and is very upset and frustrated. We have place the order to replace it.  I feel the old NOKIA is no more....that quality gone. I will recommend not to buy it.***OK if all you want is a basic feature phone for voice calls and messaging. Voice quality is not really great - so may not be useful for seniors. Phone finish and looks are average.***I chose Nokia over others for simple UI, its durability, quality and battery backup based on  performance of my old Nokia basic phones which even today are functioning without any flaws. But since Nokia has handed over its  handset production  to HMD global the quality of Nokia products especially feature phones have declined. This product Nokia 150 disappoints in every aspect like battery backup (3-4 days max in standby and 2 days if you do some calling and  play music ),camera quality(even  jiophone has better quality ,Nokia 150 will capture ghost out of you) and every thing for which i purchased it. At same or cheaper price other companies are offering better features like inbuilt call recorder , 3000mah battery with power bank feature. what is use of durability when performance is poor. I do not recommend it for basic phone user. Go for Samsung if you are using 2G network or better go for jiophone (which i have tried and tested).Regarding the  seller i.e Appario retail, they didn't mention any of the two IMEI Numbers without  which warranty can't be claimed instead they have mentioned  one IMEI number in 'order summary' where it has been clearly written that it can not be presented as an invoice. Such carelessness from highly rated seller. Soon will contact Amazon cust. Care. For that and for future purchases of mobile handsets, i will make sure before buying that seller mentions atleast one IMEI no. In tax invoice or serial no. in cade of other electronic items.Thanks.***This was classified as a Sr. Citizen mobile and I purchased it for an elderly person. While the mobile is good, simple operation, etc. IT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS A SENIOR CITIZEN MOBILE - THE KEYS ARE TOO SMALL, SCREEN FONT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER, THERE IS NO SINGLE TOUCH DIALING AND NO DISTRESS CALL BUTTON. DISAPPOINTED SINCE THIS IS BEING TOUTED AS A SR. CITIZEN MOBILE BY ALL.***this is an excellent basic phone. I bought it for my mother. Using the phone is quiet easy. battery back up is excellent overall phone can be recommend for new purchase***I'm fully satisfied with my new Nokia 150 . It withstand my all the expectation. But don't expect a lot from it as Nokia can't give a lot of features in this price it. It's rings for few seconds and then the call gets rejected. camera is of standard quality .These were the only drawbacks of this phone, otherwise the phone is fabulous and gives that nostalgic feeling like other Nokia phones give.***I am using small phone besides my smartphone. My old nokia got damaged after 6 yrs so i opted for nokia again. But when compared to quality with old nokia its not standing anywhere. Very disaapointing from Nokia. Functions which were simple made complicated.***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.***1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product.***I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.***One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.***OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.***Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!***Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working***",

  "cust_review": "The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering \"mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money\". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime. In then situation, when there was good network in Samsung mobile, no network in redmi & lenovo A6000.This is the build quality of Chinese mobile.***",

  "cust_review": "Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***",

  "cust_review": "I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE\u2014It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS\u20141) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons\u20141) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT\u2014If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box. Running Smooth.***Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...***1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal***Worst camera and ear piece is really horrible.. There is no Samsung pay also.. Honestly the worst phone to buy***",

  "cust_review": "The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering \"mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money\". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime. In then situation, when there was good network in Samsung mobile, no network in redmi & lenovo A6000.This is the build quality of Chinese mobile.***",

No haptic effect(vibration) when you press the soft key in the bottom of the phone.2.OTG issue resolved (connect the OTG cord to the phone and wait for the notification,then connect the pendrive to the cord,then wait for a while a notification  would pop on the display and you can also access the same in my files.)Hope Samsung solves the above issue...!!!***Not a good purchase at the price point,lags a lot and there is no app lock in the phone. U have to download a third party app lock to lock ur apps and that is not safe at all.***cons..battery life is below average..and lagging on the first day itselfgood..camera is above average.Low light photography is also working betterCamera live focus also perfectand good design.Cool and amazing display***I'm using Samsung A30 for the past 3 days, on the bright side its good deal for 17k, which is Andriod Pie(v9.0)Super AMOLED displayFront Camera 3.5/5Rear Camera 4/5Processor 4/5Battery 4/5.Coming to the cons side there is nothing much to say but after my observation, the WiFi reception is a bit lagging.So overall it's a good purchase.***",

  "cust_review": "A good attempt for making a senior citizen friendly phone. Only problem is while adding picture contacts it does not take from contct book and we have to add the names manually.The torch is very dim. For senior citizens they need a more powerful torch as their eyesight will be poorer than us.There should be an android version also because then videos can be played very effectively and the old members can have contact with their dear ones through whatsapp and other such apps.The dock charging facility is very convenient for old people who may not be able to connect the charging cable correctly.***Purchased for my mom. Earlier used Aasan (i ball) for 4 years.This item not compatible with Hearing Aid as claimed. Screen lock gets fixed & battery has to be removed to unlock. Hands free speaker sounds not good. Plastic uses is not of good quality. Often fails to ring. Camera is useless.I wanted to return it but return window closed now. Only good thing is cradle charging. Aasan-2 was much better. Overall poor Chinese stuff.***so i got this phone for my Grandma.. the phone seemed to be feature packed and apt for a senior citizen. HOWEVER, it has just barely been a week and the display has gone blank! Even when the display was on it was flickering.. and today i saw some more reviews highlighting the same problem.. Moreover, the product offers only a replacement and not a refund (unless you call amazon customer service). Something to bear in mind if you are thinking of buying this garbage..I would not recommend this product to anyone..P.S.: \"Three Cheers\" to the amazon customer service who understood the issue and offered a full refund though the return policy only mentioned replacements.***Purchased for my elder parent. Very loud quality at the time of ringing can listen to other rooms also. Very easy to operate and the keys are the bigger one. Recommended for Sr. citizens or who wants a basic phone with good quality.***this is a very good phone. I had bought their earlier model a few years ago for my mother and now this one as a replacement for that phone. These phones are custom designed for use by old people and suits my mother who is 82 years old. Simple to use with large buttons and a large font display , they are the best in market for senior citizensgood loud sound, big buttons, large font in display, charging cradle, a large handset so it is easy to hold for old people, these are some of the sensible features of this phone***No doubt, the product is good. But not functioning at present. I kept inside my side pant pocket, suddenly rain started, I ran and stood under the selter, when I reached my home and kept on the table and found all the key board lights are blinking including the torch also. I have tried to off the phone but could not. I had an impressions that may be due to moisturization and opened back side of the phone separated the battery and kept the phone under sun light for some times and tried after some times but not functioning. It seems that phone is to be repaired. Since the phone is under warranty, requesting your intervention to short out the said discrepancy at earliest please. Please do the needful and oblige. Best Regards, Sandipan Sarkar.***Worst product for seniors.. they cheated me with price first but Amazon fixed it for me. I had ordered it for my father and he been complaining display isn't good so I thought he ain't used to it.. now that I'm home and I see the screen is weird and sometimes even becomes totally white and have to restart to fix it. And even after restarting it would go blank in times.***THOUGH DESIGNED FOR SENIOR PARENTS, THIS PHONE CAN BE USED BY PEOPLE IN ALL AGE GROUPS.NO FEAR OF WHATSAPP / FACEBOOK DISTURBANCE (OF GOODMORNIG/ GOODNIGHT WISHES).NO FEAR OF OUR PERSONAL DATA BE STOLEN. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH OF ADVANTAGES.EXCELLENT THOUGHTFUL DESIGN AND USER FRIENDLY.  PLEASE DON'T EXPECT MORE THAN THAN BY COMPARING WITH SMARTPHONES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD AND IT IS ENOUGH IN FACILITIES.Only thing I want to know is :  How to stop one feature of this phone which automatically contact something behind and Rs.0 . 05 paisa is being reduced from the Balance in regular interval of time duration 10 or 15 minutes. and calculate the total money reduced in full day.Let the Maker, please help and answer to stop this feature as optional.Except this All other features are UNQUESTIONABLE.NICE PHONE FOR EVERYONE.***",

  "cust_review": "A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide \"Double Tap\" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is \"unnis-bees ka farak\" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2. The excellent battery even with heavy games3. Games are running quite good specially PubGNot Recommended***i was use of mi phone before a long time...but one day my friend suggested me that use of Samsung device...so i will try it and purchased Samsung Galaxy A50... really guys it's a very excellent phone...\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc97 it's display was best as other devices....best picture quality capture by this phone.... thank you for best price segment mobile phone provided by Samsung.... also my friend hiren Patel....who suggested me for this device \ud83d\udc4c\u270c\ud83d\udc4d***Unbelievable product from Samsung, much confident now , with new interface like , one  UI, in display fingerprint sensor etc***Device heat too much during audio call or video call***",

  "cust_review": "A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide \"Double Tap\" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is \"unnis-bees ka farak\" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2. The excellent battery even with heavy games3. Games are running quite good specially PubGNot Recommended***i was use of mi phone before a long time...but one day my friend suggested me that use of Samsung device...so i will try it and purchased Samsung Galaxy A50... really guys it's a very excellent phone...\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc97 it's display was best as other devices....best picture quality capture by this phone.... thank you for best price segment mobile phone provided by Samsung.... also my friend hiren Patel....who suggested me for this device \ud83d\udc4c\u270c\ud83d\udc4d***Unbelievable product from Samsung, much confident now , with new interface like , one  UI, in display fingerprint sensor etc***Device heat too much during audio call or video call***",

  "cust_review": "hi nice mobile nice camera everything Perfact i love vivo***Fastest delivery by amazon. Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after \"is\" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

  "cust_review": "A good attempt for making a senior citizen friendly phone. Only problem is while adding picture contacts it does not take from contct book and we have to add the names manually.The torch is very dim. For senior citizens they need a more powerful torch as their eyesight will be poorer than us.There should be an android version also because then videos can be played very effectively and the old members can have contact with their dear ones through whatsapp and other such apps.The dock charging facility is very convenient for old people who may not be able to connect the charging cable correctly.***Purchased for my mom. Earlier used Aasan (i ball) for 4 years.This item not compatible with Hearing Aid as claimed. Screen lock gets fixed & battery has to be removed to unlock. Hands free speaker sounds not good. Plastic uses is not of good quality. Often fails to ring. Camera is useless.I wanted to return it but return window closed now. Only good thing is cradle charging. Aasan-2 was much better. Overall poor Chinese stuff.***so i got this phone for my Grandma.. the phone seemed to be feature packed and apt for a senior citizen. HOWEVER, it has just barely been a week and the display has gone blank! Even when the display was on it was flickering.. and today i saw some more reviews highlighting the same problem.. Moreover, the product offers only a replacement and not a refund (unless you call amazon customer service). Something to bear in mind if you are thinking of buying this garbage..I would not recommend this product to anyone..P.S.: \"Three Cheers\" to the amazon customer service who understood the issue and offered a full refund though the return policy only mentioned replacements.***Purchased for my elder parent. Very loud quality at the time of ringing can listen to other rooms also. Very easy to operate and the keys are the bigger one. Recommended for Sr. citizens or who wants a basic phone with good quality.***this is a very good phone. I had bought their earlier model a few years ago for my mother and now this one as a replacement for that phone. These phones are custom designed for use by old people and suits my mother who is 82 years old. Simple to use with large buttons and a large font display , they are the best in market for senior citizensgood loud sound, big buttons, large font in display, charging cradle, a large handset so it is easy to hold for old people, these are some of the sensible features of this phone***No doubt, the product is good. But not functioning at present. I kept inside my side pant pocket, suddenly rain started, I ran and stood under the selter, when I reached my home and kept on the table and found all the key board lights are blinking including the torch also. I have tried to off the phone but could not. I had an impressions that may be due to moisturization and opened back side of the phone separated the battery and kept the phone under sun light for some times and tried after some times but not functioning. It seems that phone is to be repaired. Since the phone is under warranty, requesting your intervention to short out the said discrepancy at earliest please. Please do the needful and oblige. Best Regards, Sandipan Sarkar.***Worst product for seniors.. they cheated me with price first but Amazon fixed it for me. I had ordered it for my father and he been complaining display isn't good so I thought he ain't used to it.. now that I'm home and I see the screen is weird and sometimes even becomes totally white and have to restart to fix it. And even after restarting it would go blank in times.***THOUGH DESIGNED FOR SENIOR PARENTS, THIS PHONE CAN BE USED BY PEOPLE IN ALL AGE GROUPS.NO FEAR OF WHATSAPP / FACEBOOK DISTURBANCE (OF GOODMORNIG/ GOODNIGHT WISHES).NO FEAR OF OUR PERSONAL DATA BE STOLEN. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH OF ADVANTAGES.EXCELLENT THOUGHTFUL DESIGN AND USER FRIENDLY.  PLEASE DON'T EXPECT MORE THAN THAN BY COMPARING WITH SMARTPHONES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD AND IT IS ENOUGH IN FACILITIES.Only thing I want to know is :  How to stop one feature of this phone which automatically contact something behind and Rs.0 . 05 paisa is being reduced from the Balance in regular interval of time duration 10 or 15 minutes. and calculate the total money reduced in full day.Let the Maker, please help and answer to stop this feature as optional.Except this All other features are UNQUESTIONABLE.NICE PHONE FOR EVERYONE.***",

Why wasn\u2019t it notified on the buying screen ?!? Whose going to fix this now ?***This phone is very good and working fine. Be Indian and Buy Indian.  Worth buying for the money spent on Indian cordless. Cause I bought 2 Panasonic cordless and both failed in short term.  This one is going on and on..,...***Delivered well in time. Appearance excellent, Have been satisfactorily been using it for more than a week now. Its the only wall mountable version of cordless phone online.It can be used in standalone mode too.  Its looks are beautiful, its handy and lightweight. Has many attractive features although I have not yet used them all.***1. Cordless signal range very average2. Cordless has bug that if you charged it full and switch it off and switch it then battery will show only 1/4 dots.3. Another bug this cordless phone has when you switch to Speaker phone mode , the sound quality fluctuates like sometimes you will listen low sometimes  high volume sound.4. Battery charging is also slow.***I just loved it... Its exactly what I needed... The range is good.. battery life is good.. goes for 2 to 2 n half days...sound is also clear...user friendly... Ringtone is nice n audible even in other rooms.. features include phone book, handset settings, base settings, call settings. One drawback, the phone works on electricity, so if there is a power failure then the phone would be out of range/offline n u will not receive or won't be able to make any cslls***Waste product, with in one month thos phone is not working. I try to reach out beetel customer care but not working. 1700 RS wasted from my pocket, please don't buy from beetel any product...***Dear all. Pls don't buy this phone. Battery backup is pathetic. Even after putting it on charging for 4-5 hrs it shows 1 bar of battery charge. Rest all feature is ok but all are waste since battery ( can say oxigen of phone) is not supportive.***",

Overall good product. People can give a try... I did not face any heat issues also. Some time when I put it for charging felt the heat.

She is not well equipped with the new technology yet she got hang of it in no time. She learnt using whatsapp, facebook and other smart phone apps.  I am very happy that she is very comfortable with this phone.What she liked on the phone:Battery backupLarge displayDurabilitySpeedWhat she didn't like much:Camera quality isn't the bestNo headphones provided with the box32GB is very less space***At this price point, this is a good mobile. So far no issues faced and no lagging with applications. There is a bit of heating with video streaming and while simultaneously charging. If you don't mind having a Chinese products then it is good to go.***First of all, I am no expert in technology and stuff, so my review is purely based on my usage experience..1. Positives:a. A good phone for cost value proposition (Cant really complain if you get a smartphone within 10k)b. Good audioc. Fast charging2. Negatives:a. Terrible photo qualityb. Quality Video calling not supportedc. Developed touch and display issues within 2 months of purchase (Even a 10k phone should provide at least this basic feature of robust touch and display)***I'm writing this review after 2months of buying and till now i haven't met with any kind of problem with this phone superb picture quality sound and good vedio quality and no hanging issue. Till date..***display:- 720p less resolution cause distorted pucturesbattety :- very goodperformance :- slower than expectedsound :- not more loudmatetial quality:- very good***It's one of  the best deals under 10 K bucks .Its battery life is good if you use it wisely ,you can play pubg for around 2-3 hrs nd still Have some power left. It's picture quality is great , great sound performance overall performance is good .But it's screen is really fragile and it's backcover is useless ,with a 5D tempered nd a good protective case you're good to go.***",

Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

  "cust_review": "Looks & feel in hand: Glossy keypad over Matt finished plastic body looks Very Premium (specially the black colour)Sound quality: more than adequately loud.Ease of operation: No issue with daily operation of making calls. From in menu setting perspective I found it bit difficult at first use, but after few initial days of use everything feels line hot knife over butter.Value for money: the over all quality of material used n ease of operation, Justifies the price.Thumsup for Motorola.***The speaker phone is only for hands free dialling-this was not specified/highlighted in the write up/brochure. The hand set speaker is apparently of poor quality since those who receive calls from me complains of poor volume/voice quality.***Weak little  Speaker in here, no mute button ...imagine that.So everytime you want to mute, you got to keep your hand on the microphone.Talk about product-design.***It is a good phone. Build quality and clarity is excellent. I am giving the product 3 stars because description is misleading. It does not have an alpha-numerical caller-id and can store only numbers. The phone book too is numerical only. What is the use of storing certain numbers if you can't tag who it belongs to?***Build quality is good. Ringtone options are pretty bad. There are 24 to choose from but most of them are just nonsense. Voice quality seems good. Button layout is quite bad. For instance R is not for Redial. There is a dedicated P button that does not seem to have any use on our connections. There is no sense to the menu option. Had to consult the manual for everything from configuring the clock to finding out how to set quick dial buttons.***Merit:Looks good.Low sound key press/smooth keys.Has redial,hands free and memory(dialed list + speed dial with 2 button).Demerit :1. No back light, difficult in night, you need a separate light to use it.2. The memory is only till you restart. As my phone connected to router, any time I restart the memory wipes out. So everytime I need to set the speed dial so elder people can use.***Please don't buy for caller ID purpose if you have BSNL landline. This will not work since it uses FSK technology, while BSNL uses DTMF technology. Otherwise it's a good phone.***I had purchased this phone on 6th April 2019, till date everything is going perfectly. Sound is also very clear and ring tone also very good. I will recommend to purchase the phone. But only thing is that every time power should be connected to it. Else once power off, the phone will be dead. So better use a UPS if there is continously power cut.***",

That's why this cordless phone is not much useful for them whose calls run over 10 or 15 mins.If you keep the phone close to the mouth then only the opponent can hear your voice. Can't use easily like mobile phone or corded phone.Totally waste of money. I suggest don't buy Beetel X-81.***Pros: very good product in terms of ergonomics, looks pretty neat and classy. Has wide variety of features which i found missing on my previous panasonic. Volume of both speaker and ear piece is good.Cons: battery life could have been a bit robuts ortherwise does it job pretty much.***Not worth a penny, infact go for the basic model of 1500 to 1600 around. Much better then these crap one.***Very nice look and product is super***Phone feel and features are good, even after changing 1200mah battery for 25mins call 70% of batter got drained out....returned the product***Product is not working i want to return it.when i open it on 24.4.19 and charge it and connect to use it is not working.so i want to return but last date wad 24.4.19 so what to do***Classy looks and good for home use***",

When you join 3rd person on a call they won't listen when you talk (issue is with not with operator)2.Heating issue when on phone on a charge3.App Crash when you switch from one to another even with normal appsSo, I have been talking to so called Amazon Technical Team and trying my best to convince to refund my money, let's see how it goes..hope they read my review and respond soon..***Been using this phone since 3 months from now .. happy with the performance.Battery back up and pic quality is good.Only cons is that the face recognizion is a bit slow compared to other phones in market.....***=> DesignWell, Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body. Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

  "cust_review": "Guys don't buy this model of Xiaomi, coz their is too many problem in this device also battery is drawing very very quick, I'm so frusted to spent 13000 worthless, pls go with Note 5 pro I think that phone  has commandable for battery life***This phone looks very nice1) photos in day light or good light is awesome2) selfie flash is not good, in dark you cant expect too much from front flash poor quality, rear flash does good job3) portrait mode is also awesome in daylight (both front with AI and rear with second camera) but in low light quality is poor, portrait mode doesn't supports flash.4) you gets 1.2GB free out of 3 GB and 22GB out of 32GB5) face unlock and fingerprint does good job6) screen size is awesome and screen quality (picture quality) is goodI got this phone at effective price of 7200/- and its awesome product for this price, overall photo quality is awesome in daylight and in good light but in low light quality reduces greatly.I am very happy with phone with effective price of 7200/-Dont buy its 4 GB Version other better products available at same cost  and buy only if you get on offer.***If you want to buy a good phone within 10000 I am suggesting you this phone best camera plus everything is good. Best thing no heating while playing PUBG \ud83d\ude02***Below are the issues1. When you join 3rd person on a call they won't listen when you talk (issue is with not with operator)2.Heating issue when on phone on a charge3.App Crash when you switch from one to another even with normal appsSo, I have been talking to so called Amazon Technical Team and trying my best to convince to refund my money, let's see how it goes..hope they read my review and respond soon..***Been using this phone since 3 months from now .. happy with the performance.Battery back up and pic quality is good.Only cons is that the face recognizion is a bit slow compared to other phones in market.....***=> DesignWell, Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body. Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

Within 4 months of its purchase, the only speaker has started misbehaving for the second time. I got it repaired and now again it has reached the same stage. Nokia needs to develop/reopen its service centers back.***Right from the beginning the set is not functioning  properly.The issues are:1. Calls do not go through many times even when the signal strength is very good.2. Contact numbers are getting jumbled up / mixed up with other contacts3. Either the mike or speaker stop functioning / erratic. Either my voice is not heard on other side or other side could not be heard.Amazon has disowned responsibility so also Nokia.This was complained to Amazon, but of no help. I have lost confidence in both Amazon & Nokia. If the product is not replaced, legal action will be initiated***This will be to the point. All the selling features of this phone turn out to be disadvantages in the longer run.-> Durable - Phone starts feeling really heavy really soon-> Carl Zeiss lens - But software that processes images is crap-> Android One - Just a blunder. Provides you with unlimited storage on cloud. Sounds awesome, doesn't it. It will take a day or two for you to realize that the phone does not have a local gallery at all. All the images reside in the cloud so you cannot (I am shaking my head in disbelief) You cannot see your pics when there is no internet.***Dislike1. Camera quality - bad2. Battery life- bad (does not last day)3. Touch - Non feather touch4. Only 2 slots5. Hangs a lot.***I am a hardcore lover of Nokia phones, I used Blackberry phones only during Microsoft Lumia years.Nokia 5800 XpressMusic was my first Symbian based smartphone, then i changed to Nokia Lumia 720. then Blackberry after that this worthless junk Nokia 6.1.OMG! How stupid and frustrating is this!I am not able to complete the registration of google account using our high speed WiFi connection.I reset the phone 5 times during the first day.after skipping the google reg.process i am not able to sign in my outlook account, spotify, twitter, facebook etc.but YouTube videos are playing very well, google chrome is working very well...What kind of phone is this? i am a Techie, So i tried it to solve that issue by many ways, but nothing happens.This is as stupid as Microsoft's user experience. Google's User Experience people are a bunch of complete morons...The only positive side of this phone is the built quality and hardware. software part sucks...Note: After updating its OS to Android Pie Nokia OZO Audio gone ... So no premium audio experience with this device anymore.You can not skip this update guys... so no special audio enhancements.I am thinking of returning this useless junk.So Beware of this issues with the phone guys...***A bit on a heavier side, feels quite big for a single hand usage..Heating issues initially which is now sorted over subsequent android security updates..Camera is amazing in day light, enough for non detailing purpose or mobile photography..Performance is quite good not as bad as seen in reviews, even the fingerprint touch is quick.Bought this for 11,600\u20b9,13,999\u20b9 -1,399\u20b9 (10%) -1,000 (cashback)4gb/64gb variant is good with the performance and the metallic colour n all metal unibody!Was hesitant initially looking at the reviews but when actually put in use for few days, doesn\u2019t feel as bad as the reviews seen!There are lots of other portals with complete reviews and videos.Everyone has their own needs and expectations, this suited mine..Notch and bezel less design, I\u2019m afraid I would break it easily so I went for this model...***",

  "cust_review": "The device material is too bad. When i set the battery by adding a SIM card in it, and try to switch it on, it starts, but by pressing any key it goes switch off. after so many times, i found that the battery get disconnected by pressing any keys frequently any time. so you have to use this mobile like a cup of glass. If mobile pressed little bit in pocket, it goes switch off. if press the lock button little harder, mobile goes switch off. Really bad device if you wont get a proper model or tough body mobile. I have asked for replacement, lets see what my luck will say on replaced mobile. Otherwise i definitely ask for refund. All the best to new buyers.***Do not buy. The battery life is less than 7 months. After 6 months it is not even coming for one phone call. The bad part is that they give battery warranty only for 6 months. I bought to help my mom, but it ended up as a discomfort. Now i need to find another phone.Speaker phone quality is bad. Senior cannot hear at all :(. Only plus is the key pad which is big. Rest is all zero.***Excellent phone for senior citizens. Got it for my mom and she's very happy using it. She hasn't used the SoS feature etc but the speed dial and big buttons are so handy. This is the review after using it for two months!***Useless Mobile quality, stopped working frequently. Giving pain and tension to SR. Citizen.  That's reason product return Window is 15 days. It don't work and most unreliable phone. Just wasted money.***Seniorworld Easyfone is an excellent product matched with equal service support from the seniorworld . I brought this product for my senior citizen mother who is 80 years with multiple problems of parkinson, hearing problem and arthiritis and usual age related ailments ( loneliness - esp after the loss of her companion of 56 years a few years back. Easyfone has become her second best companion after me her son with whom she can keep in touch with with it's better speech quality and easy big digit pad and clock etc. In her over eagerness to keep the phone charged always she has been keeping it plugged on always which led to the battery going bad on the 11th month of the one year warranty. One call to the Seniorworld executive at gurgaon the battery was replaced without extra charge and even though I had purchased it through amazon. I recommend this simple easyfone a must have all senior elders at home.SeniorWorld Senior Citizen Friendly Easyfone (Black)***I Love the phone, Delivered in my friend\u2019s house and brought it here in Saudi Arabia ahead of the said delivery date, Good for the elderly  and I can\u2019t wait to Bring this in the Philippines and  give to my Uncle.***This phone is basically for uneducated and very old age persons. They can't read English. There is no Telugu language. An educated elder person can use smartphone. It is very difficult to operate. No shortcut options. Sos function is not working properly, it is repeatedly calling sos numbers until we turn off sos.***My search for phone with large keys and legible font ended as soon as I found easyfone..I'm glad that I bought not one but 3 phones..Elders in my family loved it ..They enjoy the radio feature and are also glad to listen to old and devotionl songs with the help of dedicated micro sd card (slot provided)Cradle charger enables them to simply place the phone in it rather than going through the trouble of finding a small charger point..Overall I definitely recommend it as I said I purchased 3 phones..Big thank you and \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d***",

But this phone take 3 to 4 houses for charging and I will not recommend the same anyone to purchase this mobile phone I am extmtrmley disappointed***I purchased this Honor product after a lot of research from Amazon browsing through day and night searching for the qualities like screen resolution,camera quality and battery performance. Then I found this. With its great stylized look,the product really feels premium and feels like nothing is there in your pocket. I am using this product for the last 2 days and found it performing as per my desire.It has pro's like;1)Great camera quality2)stunning Display3)Nice battery back-up which can sustain you through your whole day,( My internet always stays on and I usually do browse youtube and whatsapp mostly) It still can survive for almost  1 day with average usage.Cons:1) Loudspeaker quality is just like radio, but the normal earpiece sound is very great,loud and clear too.2) No earphones in box.Overall satisfied with the product. I recommend to everyone. Just go for it.***I have habbit of changing mobile in every week or with in a month I brought this mobile by checking it's specifications but believe it this mobile is very cheap only the outer look is  premium but camera is like pure China mobile less than 8 MP display fell is like TFT cheap one I kindly suggest don't waste the money by buying this u can go from realme u1 it's is much premium and super camera and good display***Camera is too good...High performance***Receive the product today, first look is nice, got system update, after installing I will share the performance and other thing of this product.Now after few days of use:1. Camera awesome2. Performance is so smooth, can play pubg and free fire without any problem.3. Battery backup is so surprising compared to 4k mah, it last 2 days with normal use and it lasts 10 to 11 hour with gaming and other apps. I think really nice battery, I m so satisfied with this mobile mind blowing choice. Don't think guys definitely you will not regret after purchase this device.And last but not least thank u amezon to bring it in summer carnival offer. 4-64 GB shaphire blue variant***Mobile is very nice to use, and smooth functioning and only thing about honor for best function we should not over load memory so we have to use memory card first I bought honor 8 smart after 2 years of usage with out any problems I exchanged the phone and bought (upgrade) honor 10 lite, and this is full screen phone looks very nice and looks like pro see man one thing I bought honor smart 8 before 2 years and I works nicely and I exchange it for new honor product this is the highlight so regarding the quality no issues for 2 years so I conclude u one thing is this honor brand are having more than 36 months of value to use with out any issues so if u bought honor u will sticking to same brand how is this possible coz the quality of the brand Amazon service is also very nice 2 day delivery if u want to see more about honor phone and manufacturer u can see the review of honor 8 smart mine reviewers name Senthil kumar with phone number guaranteed and longest review for honor 8 smart and my review will be in first five review after 2 monts still smooth body problem and relaxed no problem fell relaxed because I already bought honor mobiles that also smooth and so it also smooth***Not good as expected, especially performance at this price range***",

  "cust_review": "Guys, I am in a confusion for about 3 weeks on which phone to buy in the sale season. Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4cPicture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.\ud83d\udc4dI saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***",

You never have an option from Amazon for return for this product as they only offer you a exchange which is annoying when the phone itself if not compatible, how will a return/replace will work. Better to go with Redmi or other branded phone which really would be worth buying .***I got this phone @ very good cost after exchange.. merely 7000... I haven't had read reviews as well.. There was nothing to think, i directly purchased it..  to my surprise, this phone came out to be exceptional.. Very good battery life, display, sound quality.. The only thing which needs improvement is the camera quality - not sure if Vivo can still improve the same via System Updates. Considering the price range, Portrait mode still delivers good pics. Face recognition & touch sensors are fast.. Don't forget you also get NOTCH display in this price.. No heating issue.. Phone looks are premium.. There are lots of actually smart features inside which are useful in day to day use ---- i wud say actually a smart phone.. Also got one-time free screen replacement in the offer period..  I'm happy using this phone since last 10-15 days... Thank You Vivo & Amazon for the same.***Vivo Y83 smartphone was launched in May 2018. The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720 pixels by 1520 pixels at a PPI of 270 pixels per inch. Vivo Y83 price in India starts from Rs. 13,290*.The Vivo Y83 is powered by 2GHz octa-core processor and it comes with 4GB of RAM. The phone packs 64GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 256GB via a microSD card. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Vivo Y83 packs a 13-megapixel (f/2.2) primary camera on the rear and a 8-megapixel front shooter for selfies.The Vivo Y83 is powered by a 3260mAh.

Sensors on the phone include Face unlock, Fingerprint sensor, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor and Gyroscope.***Build quality is enough good. It's slim and looks sexy but the UI is not of my taste. One thing everyone knows that you'll never get next upgrade of android in these device/Brands(for cheap phones) because of the crowd of these phone from ViVO. Finally I would say Excellent phone but if you are little aware of software upgrades and upcoming security, just think once.Amazon shopping experience is always being better and better and no doubt quick delivery and better packaging for an ordinary customer(non-prime).Have a nice shopping .***The phone is good and great deal in 6600 due to exchange during sale period. The salients are:-Average display but size great size, performs  smoothly on normal task but slow compare to same category rivals. Battery one dag normal use. Finger print  face lock works well. Camera main is ok type, selfie camera not at par, no dim light option. Camera is just acceptable. 2 sim and 1 memory card slot is good.  Some unique features in cluttered funOS UI copied from apple. Overall not so good in 13-14 k but ok in sub 10k range.***Headache phone, audio doesn't play sometimes while watching YouTube videos, Face unlock occasionally works, it's new phone and its stucking, Im fed up with this and tried for exchange and to my surprise I was shocked by seeing the exchange price 1/3rd of the original price. Plz don't buy n become fools like me.***Camera is good if you have severe self esteem issues, the selfie camera just distorts your face into something bizarre. You look bleached in the photos taken using front camera. I just hate that. Rear camera is okay.Battery is decent.What i have problems is with opening the app drawer, swiping from bottom to top does not always work. Fails one out of every 3rd attempt.***",

Phones in the price range of 7k have better pictures and screen quality with the battery. Really bad product from Honor. They should take this device off the shelves or sell it for 7999 with mentioning the camera as 5mp. Yes the camera is definitely 13mp on paper but the output is very bad. I thought it was just because of the screen but when i check the pics on my laptop they look even worse.I am returning the device thankfully amazon did agree to it.

It has very good power management and the battery lasts easily for over 2 daysBut i was shocked to see the really bad quality of the display and camera. Phones in the price range of 7k have better pictures and screen quality with the battery. Really bad product from Honor. They should take this device off the shelves or sell it for 7999 with mentioning the camera as 5mp. Yes the camera is definitely 13mp on paper but the output is very bad. I thought it was just because of the screen but when i check the pics on my laptop they look even worse.I am returning the device thankfully amazon did agree to it. I have used honor 9lite and it was fantastic device at 9999. But this Honor is utter crap.***Camera \ud83d\udcf8 quality 10/9Battery \ud83d\udd0b life 10/10Screen quality 10/9***Not worth for moneyPoor camera clarity ( front & rear)Poor display quality.Sound ok.Don't buy***Worst mobile camera quality is very bad its like low mgp***",

When you join 3rd person on a call they won't listen when you talk (issue is with not with operator)2.Heating issue when on phone on a charge3.App Crash when you switch from one to another even with normal appsSo, I have been talking to so called Amazon Technical Team and trying my best to convince to refund my money, let's see how it goes..hope they read my review and respond soon..***Been using this phone since 3 months from now .. happy with the performance.Battery back up and pic quality is good.Only cons is that the face recognizion is a bit slow compared to other phones in market.....***=> DesignWell, Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body. Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too. But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera . score (7/10)=> performanceYes, It offer a lag free experience . It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***",

  "cust_review": "My phone is not working for last 1 month, I have tried calling Amazon customer care they said that it is a service issue please contact authorised Nokia service centre. As per the suggestion I went to a Nokia care and after seeing the phone's display problem and the bill they bluntly told that the phone is under replacement warranty and they are not supposed to give support. From there I called up Amazon customer care and narrated the same. The lady over phone also spoke with the Nokia care personnel but she also could not come out with any solution and insisted me to try other service centre. As per the discussion I showed the phone and the bill to another Nokia service centre which is almost 75 km away from the previous one. But the wording of the Nokia service personnel is same as before that this particular model is under replacement warranty and they are not authorised to do anything. Now I would request Amazon from whom I have bought the phone to give me a solution for this. Hope you understand my problem and resolve the issue.Thanks.***Faltu phone plz dont Buy this product..even at 50%. Within one month Display Gone.poor sound Quality.After going to Service Center They denied to repair the phone coz of i brought the phone from Amazon.than after i called amazon tollfree they told to get me Denied letter.Now i have to Dance here an there?***First off this product is a Beauty. Being an old Motorola Fan, I feel Nokia has done well w.r.t. this phone design.Many may complain, that build quality is not that great, but I beg to defer.I feel the build quality is superb for its price, the display is cool, that curve is sexy.Being so used Power Thirsty Mobiles, the new 3310 was charged to 100% a couple of days' ago, and even after fiddling it, playing music, FM Radio, it still shows a full Battery. I am going to wait to see when I need to charge it next, will post that information in about a week's time.So based on the price I paid, here is my overview of the product (I am not giving the specs here, that is available on the website.)That dual SIM + microSD card option is an awesome addition to this tiny phone. I have placed a 32GB memory card in there.Excellent - Build Quality, Display, Camera, Size, Weight, Keypad, Navigation, Voice reception, and mic.Good - Inbuilt speaker, Headset.Bad - Nothing (In my opinion, have everything I need in this phone for this price)***really very very amazing phone. build quality is very good it looks like premium phone. its easy to use and it is a handy phone. in my family most of all the family members uses nokia 3310 as a secondary phone. Batteryry backup is good camera quality is also good. i use this mobile in last 1 year and i didn't face any problem or my mobile also fall on the floor many times but there is no crack in the phone or there is no scratch in the phone body. Yea the price of this phone is bitter high but if you want a premium quality phone they go with it. I Love This Phone.***I not get battery good***Got this phone for my mom who didnt want any internets or whatapps. It looks very cute. But audio is poor, and speaker quality is also poor. I expected better from this iconic phone of the 2000's.***Defective piece. Cursor key not working on pressing. Disappointed. On replacement reauest courier guy came but didnot pick up the set rather told contact amazon office***The build quality is very bad and ipurchase it after some time the  flash light is automatically stop doing then i returned it next dayMy experience is very bad.***",

At times my home screen gadget  clock time don't get updated.  It's a clear bad bug. Yet times I was mistaken watching time on my device.***Excellent display, super fast charging, great feel ad very fast.Easily handles many apps open at the same time and heating issues are not a bother too. Sound is nice but beware it has only 1 speaker although there are two grills on the body of the phone. Can't understand why Lenovo did this . The phone has already got latest Oreo update, along with enhancements to sound, performance and camera.Camera is great at this price band.The biggest issue is that it does not support dual 4G Standby as described in the specs. Only one SIM will become 4G while the other will shift to 3G/2G. That is ridiculous. I bought it on seeing the features shown on the product page saying \"Dual 4G Dual Standby",

  "cust_review": "Bang for buck. Not even hanged single time, using it as primary device since my miA2 was stolen.Definitely I miss camera but battery life is Insane. I get around 5-6 hours of screen on time.Smooth UI ,no bloats or ad business going on.Sound quality is good and also signal reception.I have used Redmi 4a and 5a but I prefer this over those because of stock android like UI and essential phone type work.***Very good product I like it***First of all thanks to amazon and the courier boy is also worth mentioning that he had patience and was good bcoz I took some more time to complete payment... Now coming to the productNice in budget smartphones... What I liked is good battery with fast charging, nice front camera for video call, rear camera is fine, included back cover and screen protector in box also earphones means not required to purchase extra things, android go means will be providing update for 2 years... Speaker also good, one more thing which I like is gestures like double tap wake up and when screen is off and you make 'V' its flash is lit...Only the main negative point is ram is 1gb that doesn't allow to run two apps simultaneously... I also would have preferred 2gb variant but when I purchased, its 2gb variant was not released in market...Overall well and good...Today when the representative took feedback on call and asked about rating, I told that will give 4 stars for which he didn't convinced for more and only replied to write a review... But since rating matters I am giving 5 stars.***Quality is superb. Speaker, battery,picture and all other features are good. I love it. This is best product under 6000. Satisfied.***I ordered it on 15th August and it come today. First impression phone was looking good. after spend some  time camera is ok for this price. daylight photo come really nice. But the portrait shots are not good. I bought this for my mom she is happy with it.***Speaker stopped working after 17 days. Mobile gets switched off automaticaally. Amazon has return policy of 10 days. It worked perfectly for 15 days and speker stopped working from 16 days. God knows what all will stop working as time pass by. Ridiculous. Dont buy lava phone.***Very bad product by lava battery life is very poor and front speaker sounds very bad***Well, the first impression looks good and the product delivers on almost all fronts as promised. So it would be so far so good situation, however it would be too early too praise or criticize, let us give it few weeks before a complete performance review and rating. For now, it looks 'Value for Money' with this price tag! Way to go...***",

They should take this device off the shelves or sell it for 7999 with mentioning the camera as 5mp. Yes the camera is definitely 13mp on paper but the output is very bad. I thought it was just because of the screen but when i check the pics on my laptop they look even worse.I am returning the device thankfully amazon did agree to it.

  "cust_review": "I bought this phone during the recent festival sale and got a great deal on it. Post exchanging my old phone, Amamzon discount & bank cashback... i had to pay around 15k for this phone...which i fell is a great deal! The delivery was on time and they also took the old phone (flipkart charges you for this process).The phone itself is quite nice. Lightweight, sleek, bright screen, fast processor and battery that lasts around 30 hrs on one charge for regular usage (watsapp, candycrush, youtube, music, short calls etc). The faceunlock and finger print scanner are fast. 6GB ram processor does make it super fast. The camera is also very good. I would recommend this phone for a budget conscious user***As Per Price too costly camera quality is not good at this price too high not satisfied with this productI have to replace it with other productBut I don't read your return policyMust change your policy for higher mrp productCustomer satisfaction must***Although the mobile is light weight but not at all value for money. The camera is 13 MP rear but with a lot of noise. Only daylight images are somewhat good. Night images with both selfie and rear camera are not good. The SD660 does a pretty good job. The software needs finishing touches. You can't delete a particular time of call from the log. Battery backup is as other phones. Phone heats up while watching a movie online or playing games.***This is the best bet at this range. The main Contender would be realme 2 pro. I had purchased both and believe me this is the better one, mainly due to the smoothness in operation. The OS in this is far better than the that of realme 2 pro. Camera is having lot of options to fiddle with. Battery backup is very good, considering the capacity easily can last a day. Will fully charge within 2 hours.***It's just been 12 days I got my phone delivered on 25th October7th November 12 day old battery was 6% kept for charging and he phone is not switching onNeed to get the replacement and the window is closedIf I go the the service center then they will open the phone which again breaks the warrantyCan someone revert on the same***First Phone  which i got had display  issues where it had faded pixels ar the bottomPerformance  is good***Terrific purchase***Best phone in this price range. Best performance,  good camera and battery life.OS feel like IOS iphone. Light weight,  easy to handle and l9ks great.Don't think to much go ahead by this mobile reasonable price compared to other same specifications phone.Don't read fake review. my recommendation the best phone in price range of 15000 (got in 10560 after exchange of mi 3sprime@6800 and no cost emi +5% discount on card.)***",

  "cust_review": "If you are looking for Nokia brand and just feature phone and i would certainly recommend it.This basic phone will be very useful for people who wants to listen to songs and capture some images (of course it is just 0.3 MP camera). It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).***Best basic mobile with front camera and front flash, and good battery life in this price, and mobile is easy to use, but I feel sound is low compared to other mobiles..***It\u2019s a gift for my mom, as she is not tech savvy and is not into smart phones. This phone is perfect for normal use and is very light and cute one!***Very good phone with very good quality Loudspeaker & mic & earpiece quality with strong standard from Nokia!Buy it!***The sound quality is bad to say the least.  When I called Nokia Customer care they promised to replace the piece and assured of pick up in 24-48 hours.  gave me a complaint no. I have also sent a mail to their customer care.  Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *. Now it is totally confusing to lock keypad. Battery backup would have been little more, still it last lasts for 2 days with Avg. Calling and playing music files***",

It has only been one month till now and the power button has broken, the phone is not getting charged though tried with all possible chargers. And the screen has also clicking issues as it hangs for hours, please don't buy this product. When I asked for return from Amazon, they gave me various reasons that should be there to return my product. I am very much unsatisfied with this. My all money of rs. 5000 has gone wasted.***I am using this phone for about 4 months now....the biggest problem is the heating issue...not only the back gets heated up during charging but even while using the phone...also the phone shuts down automatically even with battery > 50%.... although the phone looks good especially the blue back cover...i think maybe some software update might solve the heating issue..***No major complains with this product. But with prolonged usage the wifi and gps efficiency and accuracy deteriorated. The speaker volume is not that loud either. But for some people that might not be a big factor.Performance wise this phone is pretty good. But micromax products are known to hang, and this phone is no exception. Though i would say this phone does have an edge over its brothers in the market. But now better phones have been launched around this price range so options are many now.***This is great mobile phone, I will writing this reviews at this mobile. So,beautiful handset.  ........\"one a great problem in this mobile is bettery problem\". Also,[camera] are good.Other, headphone are very good.  Charger are good. Sound are not low and not high it's good sound.Blue colour at mobile look like it so..... beautiful. And leather back pocket. it nice mobile Thank you micromax and Amazon.***Good quality and sturdy phone.Voice quality can have been better as the clarity is not 100% precise.Though the description mentions 13mp camera, the photo quality is not really upto the mark.Okay for day-to-day usage, if you are not expecting any special features on this phone***Very Good phone within its range...its been 2 months using this phone and very rarely it hangs and even if it gets, it gets sorted out within seconds. Camera is not superb but good enough, never compare with the king Sony.RAM, memory , processor all working fine. Have installed multiple games and apps and nothing crashes.Battery is OK for a smartphone, phase off quickly from 100% to 70-75% and after that its normal. Videos play well, HD quality is good. Even after two months, I couldn't find a better phone in this range, 10-14K.***This is a really very good phone. it worth the money. I used it since January 2014.  Camera quality is pretty good compared to many other phone. Selfies comes really well. Just that once in a while it used to get hang or some app will not work suddenly.But once you restart it was absolutely fine. But that kind of thing happens with any smart phone. Battery stayed for one and half days even this December. Just that it got stolen recently so have to buy a new one! .One should totally go for it.***",

Displays date, time year.Red LED glows when we lift the phone.Build quality is like matte affect and not smooth finish.Buttons also hard push and not smooth touch.Sold by: TEAM TELESYSTEMSPrice : Rs.695 on 31-Oct-2018, little high.Overall Good.If found helpful, pls click 'Helpful'***The said product is used as the phone in my residential Land Line. But the telephone Binatone is not displaying caller's ID in full. Viz:- If I call my land line number the display shows  2 or 3 digits only. Not the complete 10 digits of a mobile number. Since I bought this on Nov. 7, 2018 and having one year warranty it is requested to replace this telephone with a similar model which satisfies the nomenclature of  Binatone spirit 200 phone. - Dr.N.Sankar***the phone is good.the caller id does not reveal full mobile no when the code of +91 comes.. ie the last 2 to 3 digits of the phone no is not visible. so one main function is down.would advise to buy a different phone..***It is compact,smaller therefore occupies less space than my earlier caller id instrument provided by telephone dept.It doesn't have any sharp edges......good finishing.Sound quality is ok......It has caller id,date,time,month......takes care of my needs....Good experience,value for what i have paid.***Wrong specs are provided in the details of this item.1. Lcd is not backlit.2. Only one ringtone is there.***Product is good only for few hours. Then you realise either lcd stops displaying or dialing pad not working at all. Its a  Prime item,  hence delivery and one time replacement is quick. Most frustrating is replaced item has stopped working within  48 hours. Quality control of indian and  chinese products are awful as always and this is no exception***Product is decent, easy to use.  There are 2 ringer volumes - Hi / Low which is good. Voice clarity is clear but the display is small. You can place the phone on table or there is an option to wall mount. I'm using the device for our flat intercom which serves the purpose.***The phone is not storing incoming call details. It is not even showing the incoming call number.Build quality, sound clarity, ringer volume are good for the price. But I am disappointed with the caller ID.***",

  "cust_review": "NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7\") and XR the biggest(6.1\"), with X and XS with same size(5.8\"), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps.***Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.***Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon***So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there\u2019s a glitch in the front camera\u2019s portrait mode. That\u2019s fine, it may happen. But what\u2019s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!***It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I\u2019m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.***The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you.***Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon***",

Overall design also nice. After bought the phone, there was a small issue i.e., microphone cannot work well and one more disadvantage is that speaker sound is quite low. At the same time, Android oreo(go edition) cannot run most of the apps in playstore and youtube go edition need somemore improvements for better experience like as normal youtube app. Overall performance of smartphone is better.***Camera quality little down***Product quality is too poor, not taking charging and screen pics also vibrating a lot.

  "cust_review": "I have purchased Samsung A8+ on 12th Oct and the return window was showing as \"closed 22 Oct 2018\". Yesterday on 23rd (11th day of the purchase), was started not working. I was switched off the mobile while going to a meeting and again switched on after the meeting. Then, the mobile showing- Encryption problem\". I have submitted to the Samsung service centre along with invoices and they told that- \"it may be happen due to the interruption of updates\" and it takes 4-5 days to come to a decision.I would like to draw your attention that, the phone simply become dead when I switched off.Since it was purchased \"ONLINE\" through Amazon, who will give the immediate support? The service centre is mentioning the lengthy procedure for which I have no time because I am travelling to Germany and France on 27th Oct. Usually, the return duration shall be one month on Amazon. Why it was closed in 10 days?It was a new piece and for simple reason, the phone was dead which was a manufacturing defect.I request you to consider the case and allow us for replacement in a day or two as I am the Prime customer. I have never returned any goods so far.***mobile gets heat even normal usage like chatting,talking,camera & browsing. Totally worst experience from top brand.  amazon not ready to immediate for replacememt they consider mobile temperature more than 45 c only. But now im facing 40 c eventhough this much of heat they are not ready to listen customer concern.***Best phone ever.... camera of phone is too good very nice camera quality but proccessor & graphic not so good for the games .. but over are phone are nice in this price \ud83d\udc4d***Pros :Front CameraDisplayBattery lifeIP6 certified dust and water resistantSamsung payRAMCons:Processor is not upto the mark considering the price range.Rear camera is not good.Device although has premium look but feels heavy in hand.Face unlook is not accurate.No 4K Video recordingFast Charging i observed is 1% per minute which is not much appreciated.Finally what i suggest is if you are getting this device around 22K and you are more concerned with Samsung branding like me then you can go with this device but spending 30K for this device is obviously not a good choice better go with 1Plus 5T or 1Plus 6***Let me start by saying that there are better phones in this price segment. But, if you find this phone in less than or around 20k just go for it. Its a flagship like feel. Build quality and battery life is super. Screen is just what you need. Its a Amoled display which meets expectations. Sound wise performance is superb ( Dolby support). Signal quality you can't complain about. Now, average or below average part is its camera. In daylight condition its quite good, but in poor lighting conditions it totally fails. Like a Mi phone of 10k performs better than it. This is the only downside i felt. I have been using it for now more than a month. I purchased it for 18k during tbe big billion days offers. A lot of people complain about it fingerprint sensor, let me say that it is very fast. And also the face unlock feature is not bad. It performs in low light conditions as well. I swear to it. Overall if you are normal user and not than much photogenic or selfie freak you are not going to regret it. Its a good phone after all. I am totally safisfied with it. It only there would have been wireless charging support it would be a killer.***I have Orderd this phone in Oct 2018.Aftet using a few week I m proving my feedback.1. Phone is nice2. Great 6GB RAM3. When you purchased this phone you get Android 7.1 but whan you connect the Internet your Android version will be updated with 8.4. Camera is not adequate but front camera really awesome.5. Battery backup Good as compared to other phone.6. You will also also get Free back cover in your box.7. Led Notifiaction available8. Both SIM are 4G and LTE supported means you can use both SIM simultaneously as 4G.9. Get Blue light filter for youe eyes protection.10. You can also get PANIC support by pressing 3 button.***Very disappointed with the quality of the product.In fact, I liked the feel and the software UI of the Galaxy A8+But unfortunately, it didn't last one full day. Within 24hrs of use, the screen was dead. It wouldn't turn on, nor efforts for a hard reset or charging the mobile, helped any further.Samsung needs to tighten it's QC further. There are plenty of reports online, which make it evident that the company has a very poor QC over their manufacturing process. I wonder, why is it this way with Samsung (a company that produces great flagship mobiles).Have initiated returns. Now, would think twice before buying a smartphone produced by Samsung.***Excellent phone. Fast delivery.***",

  "cust_review": "Guys, I am in a confusion for about 3 weeks on which phone to buy in the sale season. Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4cPicture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.\ud83d\udc4dI saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***",

  "cust_review": "The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering \"mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money\". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime. In then situation, when there was good network in Samsung mobile, no network in redmi & lenovo A6000.This is the build quality of Chinese mobile.***",

It\u2019s a light weighted mobile which is durable for calling purpose. A good point about this mobile is that you can use a USB charger rather than the conventional pin charger.***Not gud at all in keypad manner... But the quality rokz...

Voice is clear and the ring volume is very loud but you cannot change the wallpaper.Don't buy it from any online site. It has a replacement warranty and if anything happens then you can't repair it free of cost within the warranty period because the Nokia is not responsible for replacement. It is clearly written that the replacement will be generated from \"Point of sale\" but no online portal will replace it after replacement window closed. So, literally, it's Max replacement days= Warranty period which is hardly 10-20 days.***",

The service center told me that there is a shortage of spare parts. I have been contacting Nokia customer support almost everyday for the past one week. Now they are telling me that even they don't know when the problem will get resolved.Today bi have registered a complaint with National Consumer Helpline. I don't understand why Nokia can't provide parts for a mobile which is launched less than a year ago.They are launching new models after another but couldn't provide support for the customers.Now I will think twice before buying Nokia products.Really pathetic product and customer support.***It is working very smooth***Good phone***Worst phone.

  "cust_review": "Before I tell you about the music experience, you shouldn\u2019t forget that it costs just Rs. 1499. Also, don\u2019t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says \u201cPairing mode\u201d.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn\u2019t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone\u2019s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth\u2019s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don\u2019t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of \u20b91499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***",

  "cust_review": "Guys, I am in a confusion for about 3 weeks on which phone to buy in the sale season. Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4cPicture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.\ud83d\udc4dI saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***",

  "cust_review": "Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***",

  "cust_review": "Before I tell you about the music experience, you shouldn\u2019t forget that it costs just Rs. 1499. Also, don\u2019t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says \u201cPairing mode\u201d.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn\u2019t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone\u2019s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth\u2019s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don\u2019t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of \u20b91499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***",

  "cust_review": "Guys, I am in a confusion for about 3 weeks on which phone to buy in the sale season. Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4cPicture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.\ud83d\udc4dI saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***",

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***",

  "cust_review": "The phone instrument is good but I did not find it as expected. First of all the incoming calls volume range is very low even if the level is kept at highest volume; level 1 to level 5 only. This is the worst drawback of the instrument.Secondly the company has given around 8-9 options of ringtones but barely 2 or 3 are the appealing ones and others can not be distinguished. Thirdly i found the speaker volume [the sound / call volume of person on the other side] also a bit low***Nice device... Just received on 6th Feb. I would have given 4 stars if the speaker phone might work properly. Some sound due to echo is observed every time I try to talk over hands free mode.. Made in China by the way. Don,'t know till what time it will be functioning properly.. one can buy it if required in office.***Best match for my personal use in office. There was no ringing issue occurred once but resolved automatically!! I don't know how did it happened. But it wasn't happened again. That's why I have given it 4 star!! Otherwise I'd give it 5...***The person on the other side couldn't hear clearly if speaker mode is enabled. Mic is not sensitive enough to catch sounds originating from more than 0.5 feet away. All other features are as described in spec.***Initially it worked well. But in a span of just 4 months instrument give problem. People cannot hear at the other end.***Okay***Good quality landline phone***Decent phone. Supports CLI. Finish is average not great.***",

  "cust_review": "Fantastic phone what a performance i love it.***Disclaimer : Bought Honor View20 purely for the camera. (i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow.  You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,\u00a0 1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.***It's nor worth for money.. Camera is very normal as 12MP only. Dunno in what basis they are saying it as 48MP. It's not going zoomin dept as oneplus 6T goes. Indoor pics are not that good. Even nyt shoot ll be better in vivo or oppo than this one. If anyone is going to get this mob just for a cam don't buy. It's my suggestion. Battery is gud but not as moto or one plus provides. Display is gud.***this is my initial review will post again after few weeks1) Display (6/10)- yes its a punch hole but panel quality is average2) Selfie camera(6/10) - images are soft when taken indoors.3) Rear Camera (7.5/10) - good photos in good light, hit and a miss affair in an indoor/low light situation.4) Performance (9/10) is very good , no lags.5) There is a vibration felt in the phone when talking to someone, feels hollow inside.6) Sound output via earphones is good but not great7) Speakers are average.30k would have justified the cost for this phone but 38k its not worth.***Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.1. Look is stunning2. Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch3. Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.4. Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.5. Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.6 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)7. Sound is good, not too awesome.And You can not add external microphone in honor 20 while recording a video. But in other androids, you can add the same easily.Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) . Revised reviewThanksSiddharth Arora***Used it for more than 2 hours, the display looks great with punch hole technology. Battery life and camera are things which are yet to be tested by me. I will update this review after 2 days of use.So far so good***Better then 6t***Just now i got mobile... Excellent performance,  sounds and camera are awesome. I will post after usage of other spec.***",

  "cust_review": "I was apprehensive at first buying an Oppo phone for the first time, as I always thought about Oppo/Vivo as camera/selfie centric brands (as they have marketed themselves like that). For reference, I might add more here that I have used Redmi Note 4 last year and Honor 7x early this year, both were good phones at their prices.I exchanged my Redmi Note 4 against buying Oppo F9 Pro, and got a decent exchange price of Rs.7,100/- (incl. extra Rs.3,000/-), which was a big incentive to go for this also.Now, about the phone Oppo F9 Pro, I am purely delighted. Not only, the camera is good, the overall performance just amazed me. Yes, I am not a much of a gamer, but I load too many apps, and must I say, it works exceptionally well.Although working RAM you get is near about 3 GB only out of 6 GB, but it does the job brilliantly. Not even once it lagged anywhere. It breaks the common myth about the supremacy of snapdragon chips over all else.Oppo F9 Pro has Mediatek chip and its great.The best part is the battery back up. First of all, it charges superfast, its unbelievable. It charged from 20% to 100% within 45 min. I charged it yesterday morning, its 7pm today, and its still got 38% juice left.Thank you Amazon, once again.***Very nice good performance***Phone is not what it describes, expected with 6GB Memory. Games like candy crush and hay days get hanged and while u using any app and get a call there is no way u can receive the call, phone is hung. Worst is it gets heated up. Amazon is replacing phone after their technician inspected it and was able to replicate all problems. I only hope it is one off defective handset and not this model in particular.***Everything is good in phone.Pros1. Awesome look2. Full screen display3. Can play PUBG4. Camera5. Fast chargingCons:1. Battery gets exhausted very fast.2. Can't play PUBG in ultra HD mode3. I found its touch little slow4. Face unlock doesn't work well specially in low light.5. Phone is costlier ( you can get the same thing in realme 2 pro in lower price.***Too Good, Superb voot charging,Headphones & Amazing camera,water drop display and very good performance. I wish internal memory128 gb variant should also be available.***Since I am a OnePlus boy so, definitely no other phone gonna impress me. I am using OnePlus since its launch .i.e Aug2014. I am waiting for 7 or later as I broke my OP3. Mine OnePluse One on Cyanogen is still much smoother than this latest gadget. Also, this is a temporary phone to me. So Oppo fans, please ignore my rating. Anyways , its a good deal but price little high. Should be 1-2k less, around 20K.Other than VooC and Camera nothing much impressive. Looks are good.***1.Speed is  not upto the mark#6GB2.charging is awesome3.Battery Backup is wonderful...4.camera front and rear zoom quality is not satisfactory.5.resolution is also good partOverall 7/10 rating for this***Awesome productVOOC charging is fantasticCamera is also good.***",

It comes with 5.7-inch HD+ Full Vision Display with nice graphics and picture quality there you can enjoy watching movies and videos.2. Best thing is its battery of 4000 mah which gets fully charged in 1.5 hours and lasts for a day on a heavy internet usage and can play games for long hours without charging it.3. Selfies are past. Do the Dualfie as they say with its inbuilt dualfie feature you can click two images at one time from both the cameras i.e. a new and awesome feature of this phone.4. Looks good bcoz of this 2.5D curved glass screen which make it looks awesome and handy to carry it in hand and can work on one handed mode too.5. Somehow heating problem occurs on a long run of use or when on charging so there's need a lil bit improvement from the brand.6. Android also needs improvements as there are so many buges comes while running the most of the applications.7. Overall performance of the phone is good as when compared to its price. Nice features and specifications in this price no another brand is giving. Hence, According to your requirements and usage you can buy this.***Phone is perfectly alright.. But after giving 15% warning it shuts down in 5 minutes and also heating problem even using normally..

  "cust_review": "I was apprehensive at first buying an Oppo phone for the first time, as I always thought about Oppo/Vivo as camera/selfie centric brands (as they have marketed themselves like that). For reference, I might add more here that I have used Redmi Note 4 last year and Honor 7x early this year, both were good phones at their prices.I exchanged my Redmi Note 4 against buying Oppo F9 Pro, and got a decent exchange price of Rs.7,100/- (incl. extra Rs.3,000/-), which was a big incentive to go for this also.Now, about the phone Oppo F9 Pro, I am purely delighted. Not only, the camera is good, the overall performance just amazed me. Yes, I am not a much of a gamer, but I load too many apps, and must I say, it works exceptionally well.Although working RAM you get is near about 3 GB only out of 6 GB, but it does the job brilliantly. Not even once it lagged anywhere. It breaks the common myth about the supremacy of snapdragon chips over all else.Oppo F9 Pro has Mediatek chip and its great.The best part is the battery back up. First of all, it charges superfast, its unbelievable. It charged from 20% to 100% within 45 min. I charged it yesterday morning, its 7pm today, and its still got 38% juice left.Thank you Amazon, once again.***Very nice good performance***Phone is not what it describes, expected with 6GB Memory. Games like candy crush and hay days get hanged and while u using any app and get a call there is no way u can receive the call, phone is hung. Worst is it gets heated up. Amazon is replacing phone after their technician inspected it and was able to replicate all problems. I only hope it is one off defective handset and not this model in particular.***Everything is good in phone.Pros1. Awesome look2. Full screen display3. Can play PUBG4. Camera5. Fast chargingCons:1. Battery gets exhausted very fast.2. Can't play PUBG in ultra HD mode3. I found its touch little slow4. Face unlock doesn't work well specially in low light.5. Phone is costlier ( you can get the same thing in realme 2 pro in lower price.***Too Good, Superb voot charging,Headphones & Amazing camera,water drop display and very good performance. I wish internal memory128 gb variant should also be available.***Since I am a OnePlus boy so, definitely no other phone gonna impress me. I am using OnePlus since its launch .i.e Aug2014. I am waiting for 7 or later as I broke my OP3. Mine OnePluse One on Cyanogen is still much smoother than this latest gadget. Also, this is a temporary phone to me. So Oppo fans, please ignore my rating. Anyways , its a good deal but price little high. Should be 1-2k less, around 20K.Other than VooC and Camera nothing much impressive. Looks are good.***1.Speed is  not upto the mark#6GB2.charging is awesome3.Battery Backup is wonderful...4.camera front and rear zoom quality is not satisfactory.5.resolution is also good partOverall 7/10 rating for this***Awesome productVOOC charging is fantasticCamera is also good.***",

  "cust_review": "\u25cfThe special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.\u25cfI was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.\u25cfThe phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)\u25cfThere is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)\u25cfStock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.\u25cfEnduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.\u25cfSelfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.\u25cfScreen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1\u25cf Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1\u25cfAnd yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone \ud83d\udc4c***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***",

  "cust_review": "The phone looks and feels great and all the features as mentioned in the description appear to be good when you read it, but sadly, I haven't enjoyed this phone at all.The pictures aren't good cause the Aperture is too high. Forget about pictures in low light, FYI.Even the selfies are grainy and there's literally no stability at all.Well. Gaming. That's a Big NO. If you play high fps games then this phone isn't for you. It heats up in just two games of War Robots.Multitasking on this phone is great though. Easy to use, quite snappy and no delay in response at all.Unless, you like clicking pictures or gaming, this phone isn't for you.I'm writing this review after a use of almost 8 months. So, its all true and legit.For this price though, you should really check out the Redmi range of smartphones.***Used for a yearHeating problem (it heats more than mi phone)Glass very weak (it fell frm 7cms n broked(fell frm a dictionary) though i replaced it for free during free screen replacement period)Unexpected hanging problems (the phone hangs without any region n its very difficult to restart it afterwards too)Camera is soo soo bad,worst i have ever seen,it knew it would b bad,bt i didnt expctd it to b this bad,the front camera gvs clearer images thn the rear oneVery bad battery backup***It does have good look beside it have metallic body plus it have quite great finishing. So, overall you gonna get premium feeling.Currently, I own this phone for 6 month and I say I am impressed with it.It have good specs in it\u2019s price range.Truth is its have some less specs but its have some pro specs to. Like it have HD wide screen, its body is metalic, it have awesome look and last it have easy software which free from ads.Pro :Good look with strong metalic body.Wide HD screen.Fast and reliable.Good battery life.Ad free software.Never get issue for hang.Dual sim 4G+4G with individual slot and even for memory card slot. (Using 2 sim and memory card)Purchased  9 month 0 emi at 12K.Cons:Decent camera (I am not camera guy).Decent specs for games (I am not gamer).***I had a lot of problems with this set was continuously on call with Amazon as well as the Lg customer service teams finally returned it, The battery drainage is a definite problem as well as the middle portion of the phone was heating up alot. I trust the company and have been using alot of electronics and stuff of theirs never had any issues they are definitely much better than Chinese products their brand speaks about it also that extra star is it's one of the phones with least radiation which is one factor on my priority list while purchasing cell phones. The company needs to come up with a power pack phone which is also budget friendly because they already have a hands on, on build quality and design to compete with these oppo poco mi etc..***ProsA good 18:9 aspect ratio. Phone looks larger with slim bezels and the phone is one hand operable.Phone is responsiveComes loaded with nougat 7.1.1. Updatable to version 8.1 oreo.Camera is decent. Pictures are good quality and FB instangram shareable.Sound from single speaker is adequate. Stereo speakers desirable.Battery does not heat as claimedConsFinger print scanner could have been added4 GB instead of 3 GB would be nice.Battery of 4000 to 5000 mAh is desirable***Good phone in this price segment but sometimes it seems like the phone heats a bit. Battery backup could have been more. Camera quality is good. Touch screen and display quality is excellent. User interface is intuitive.***Phone looks extremely niche, display is vibrant,. I ordered golden color. Phone heats if used to play games for a long time but doesnt matter to me, i m not a gamer.I thought the phone i received is a used one, when i switched it on for the first time, erasing message popped up first.***Worst phone ever. Heating of this phone is the reason of global warming***",

  "cust_review": "If you are looking for Nokia brand and just feature phone and i would certainly recommend it.This basic phone will be very useful for people who wants to listen to songs and capture some images (of course it is just 0.3 MP camera). It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).***Best basic mobile with front camera and front flash, and good battery life in this price, and mobile is easy to use, but I feel sound is low compared to other mobiles..***It\u2019s a gift for my mom, as she is not tech savvy and is not into smart phones. This phone is perfect for normal use and is very light and cute one!***Very good phone with very good quality Loudspeaker & mic & earpiece quality with strong standard from Nokia!Buy it!***The sound quality is bad to say the least.  When I called Nokia Customer care they promised to replace the piece and assured of pick up in 24-48 hours.  gave me a complaint no. I have also sent a mail to their customer care.  Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *. Now it is totally confusing to lock keypad. Battery backup would have been little more, still it last lasts for 2 days with Avg. Calling and playing music files***",

  "cust_review": "It is the best smartphone I have ever used...**pros**-Clear display-Nice battery backup-no lagging issues-enough internal storage-no heating issues even after extensive gaming-IR blasters work fine-nice build quality (I dropped the phone accidentally from hand and it didn't got any single scratch)-finger print sensor works great-best for gaming and media**cons**-battery drains faster when connected to wifi-rear camera takes time to focus-size of device (if you are not used to big screens)-takes almost 3 hrs to charge from 0%-100%(as it has 4850mah battery)**overall**It is a good phone if size doesn't matter to you.Best for mobile gamers, movie freaks and everyone who loves big screen with nice resolution.***Phone is good but Mi service centre in kamla nagar is the worst, i dropped the phone and encountered issues in phone and went to kamla nagar centre for getting it fixed. but there was a huge line with very slow service. i reached there at 5, waited 1.5 hours and at 6.30 they said systems stopped working as office hours were completed. i went there next day again taking half day from office in morning hour to avoid rush but now again it took long for my turn as one of the guys there hardly works for even half time.***I would have given it  5 star rating had it not been for its pretty weak body. The phone is awesome. 1.8 GHz processor is very fast.... Camera is decent. The major con of this phone is that IT IS NOT DURABLE. If it falls down once , it's a goner. The screen is really fragile and it doesn't come with gorilla glass.... Even screen guard protection won't help it. So if you are a clumsy user, make sure you don't make this fall. Otherwise it's an awesome phone.***Mi Max screen is big and great to read or watch movies but too big to fit one's palm. Long calls are quite difficult holding the phone. Super smooth metal body, good battery life, great sound but no phone of MI comes with headphones. The front camera has no flashlight, night photos from back camera is bad too because of yellow light. Photos are great indoors in well lit spaces. Difficult to find screen guard n back cover for this sized mobile, finding accessories after two years is a trouble. Recently the fone fell down and the screen display got badly smashed but no parts were damaged and it cost me 4200 to get just the screen replaced. After sales service was prompt but parts weren't available at many mi service centers, the parts are exorbitantly priced considering that I paid 15k for buying the phone.***The most pathetic after sales serviceI have recommended mi phone to a lot of people, without knowing after sales service, now this time when I Brought one for my self this costliest device of them, with in one month back button stopped working, when given for fix after fixing that given me the device with another problem, and this was bigger than that was earlier. THEY REMOVED THE EAR PIECE SPEAKERS FROM HANDSE. With this problem I send back the device to service center and I don't know when it will come back. Even customer care executives don't know what is the companies policy regarding time line to repair the phone.I believe they don't have oneTruly a Chinese company and Chinese product. \" chale to chaad thak nahi to raat tak\"***Mi Max or MY MAX. Excellent phone with life size display. Too late to post review as ths product is no longer in production. But performance is unmatched. 625 snapdragon processor,16 mp back camera for photo fanatics,sleek and curvy design with metal body and everything else as promised. This phone is superb as i've downloaded over 40 apps and still doesnt lag or hang.Photo quality from the camera is excellent and has lots of options like beautify etc. Speakers in bottom end of phone and quality is amazing. Overall an amazing product from MI/ Xiaomi. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone.***MI ..MI.. MI.. that's what you been hearing all throughout.Quite a big size but matching mine. Just like the colour is the product \"Gold\". 2.5 years old still works great, obviously untill you throw it and show some hate.A great choice and long way to go.***Itz bn 1 year i m using it..itz my challenge u cant even find out even one drawback or fault or any kind of complaint.. it has everything someone wd  want to have it in their phone..IR remote, Screen Mirroring, fastest fingerprint, flawless screen ,incredible sound , dual apps option ,slim ,nice camera,many functions or modes in camera like slow motion and all, no heating problem ,once it is fully charged how much u use full day battery won't drain out..worth buying it...no other phone matches it.***",

  "cust_review": "Before I tell you about the music experience, you shouldn\u2019t forget that it costs just Rs. 1499. Also, don\u2019t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says \u201cPairing mode\u201d.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn\u2019t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone\u2019s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth\u2019s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don\u2019t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of \u20b91499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***",

  "cust_review": "Before I tell you about the music experience, you shouldn\u2019t forget that it costs just Rs. 1499. Also, don\u2019t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says \u201cPairing mode\u201d.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn\u2019t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone\u2019s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth\u2019s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don\u2019t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of \u20b91499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***",

  "cust_review": "I want to refund box Quality bad***Mine is just 2 months old and the screen - though claimed to be gorilla glass - got few cracks with a 1 feet fall. Fortunately the display is intact and have to use it like this now since screen is not covered by warranty. I was an mi lover and third mi phone this, but not any longer***Likes1) Amazing infrared face recognition. Fastest unlocking system ever on any OS. Haven't used the pattern or fingerprint reader once the face recognition was set up.I don't mind the notch coz of this feature.2) Accurate and blazing fast fingerprint reader.3) Best gesture based system. Period.. Way better than vanilla Android Pie. Better than iOS and OnePlus 6.4) Poco launcher makes life easier on a Xiaomi Android device.5) MIUI pie system takes 8.55 GB. Compared to the Android one Xiaomi Mi A2, whose Android Pie takes a whopping 13 GB of space.6) The feel of heft added balances the polycarbonate back compared to metal or glass.7) Not slippery. Only flagship phone that can be used without a case.8) Battery life on par with other flagships.Dislikes1) ugly notch.2) Like all MIUI , Ads are present from the usual pre installed apps. ( There's a xda developer article on how to disable most of these)3) Don't listen to the reviewers who says the liquid cooling system doesn't allow the phone to heat up. THE PHONE DOES HEAT UP.4) MIUI fails on notifications. I wouldn't use any MIUI based phone for my daily driver.5) Setting icon sometimes is hard to tap correctly on the toggle.6) Brightness sometimes gets a bit lackluster.***I've been using it for 2 months now, and so far I'm happy with it. Couple of times the phone hung but began working fine on restarting.I'll revisit this review aftwr using the phone for a year.***Nothing left to say because you should order this phone without having anything in mind, Camera to IR Face Unlock to Performance to Battery Backup just more than EXPECTATION!!! This phone doesn't even lag a microsecond no matter how many background apps you keep working with and how many games you play!!! It's a complete beast of it's all segments with having no competitor!!***The product is a real deal. The battery life is amazing! I am very much satisfied with all the features of the phone.***Lovely phone with lot of performance and with in such an amazing price tag. The snapdragon 845 processor is simply mind blowing.***So far its good , I will update the rating and review incase something comes up!***",

  "cust_review": "Motorola really deserves a 0 star rating for how well their service centres and customer care manages to dissappoint their customers. However good the product may seem never buy a Motorola product just for the way they treat their customers after purchase. It has been more than 1 year since i have been using this phone and i have been literally fighting with the service centre every now and then. Every single visit of mine to the service centre somehow ends up in a fight and i do find most of my fellow customers either supporting me or starting a fight all by themselves all through the durations of time that i spend there. From my experience i can easily say this is the worst mobile service centre you can find. If you still want to go ahead and buy a Motorola make sure you completely know how to repair your phone or make sure you do know someone who can help. In simple words Motorola SUCKS.***Few highlights after 1 year of usage:-1) Battery: Lasts a day or more. Depends heavily on the usage. Sometimes drains with 4G and draining apps.2) Camera: Expected a bit more from the camera especially the dual lens setup from Moto. It does a decent job but not top notch. Don't expect OnePlus like pictures (obviously) without editing. Selfie camera is good enough though.3) Software: Bad experience here. Motorola management and devs need to up their game because we're getting Android Oreo after almost a year while Motorola promised it in early 2018. Only security patch updates were provided for a 16k phone with other competitors in the market. Software experience is stock though which is very good, no bloatware.4) Gestures: I think the gestures and one button navigation is one of the best features of this smartphone. I use it on a daily basis (gestures only, not a big fan of single button navigation gestures but many people like it).5) Turbo Charger: Very good, provides a great amount of charge in less time. One of the best that I've seen. But the cable plastic end got frayed.6) Display & Design: Top notch for the price. One of the best in this price segment. However, the design gets wasted if you put it in a case :)7) Rest: Snapdragon 625, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, no complaints here. Performance wise its good! (Funny though that Moto G6 has Snapdragon 450 for the same price at launch! What are you doing Moto?).***Don't go for this mobile. Not at all receiving the signal and call quality is very bad. Being a 4gb ram, hanging frequently and low battery. Because of signal problem, battery is draining dramatically. Wast of  money only***Camera is not that much good in low lighting worst performance and the main Problem\u200b is in wifi issue disconnected randomly over all not worth to buy***I disliked the product. It's overheating while using any app. And super heating while on charging. In fact it's so hot that I can iron my clothes with it. I wondered why Motorola didn't hilight this iron heating portable iron feature in commercial. Also they do not provide you the replacement in customer care center they just keep repairing your brand new phone and will make it refurbished. Don't buy it people. I lost my faith in Motorola Lenovo.***I am writing this review after 10 months. So here I am sharing my personal experiences with this phone:First of all thanks to Amazon for its prompt delivery and thanks to Seller Darshita Electronics for sending this product in good condition.Pros:Build Quality: Very good build qualityPerformance: Performance is very good no lags are experienced till now.Sound Quality: Good but not much loud. I liked it personally.Camera Quality: Good in Outdoor also 4K video recording is bundled.FingerPrint Scanner: Responsive scanner. It detects the finger print quite fast.Battery Backup: Good if you are on Android Nougat. It stays almost one day of heavy usage.TurboCharging: Fast charging is available on this device and it charges quickly.Cons:Camera Quality: Disappointed with image processing from this camera. i can say it was below average. The Dual Camera setup was a disappointment. But soon Motorola had released the camera updates and it improved in great extent. I can say the Dual camera is properly implemented after lot of updates from Motorola. Color reproduction of this camera is a below average it did not process the image if i compare it with Google camera which is installed in my device and also very surprised that images shot with Google camera app are far better than the Motorola's stock camera app as it is using same sensor. Don't know why Motorola is not working on the camera quality.Camera Bumps: As we know that Camera Bumps are bit outwards on this model so there is a chance for scratches on the camera glass so better to have a protective back cover with camera protection.Regular Updates: Updates are not in the list of Motorola as they are focusing on their new models so ignoring the previous models. I have recently got the Oreo updates after so much waiting. Very poor service when it comes to the updates from Motorola.Battery backup: Battery backup deteriorates after upgrading to Android Oreo. I have noticed the next day i have to charge two time a day after upgrading. Now waiting for the next update hope this will be fixed in next update.Final Verdict: If you are a camera freak and expecting for some great shots then this phone will give you an average quality so better think for other options available in the market. But if you are an average user with some budget restrictions then go for it.The above said are my experiences with this phone and my overall rating for this phone will be 3.5.***G5s plus is best camera is really superb,sound is fantastic, battery performance is also good m doing after 2weeks m posting this review go for g5s plus it's buttry smooth low lights pictures are also good daylight pic are really amazing what Moto need to imporve is front camera with portrait mode nothing else  m really happy with my g5s plus sry for not more pictures due to some problem with photos that's y I upload a single pic about battery and that's amazing superb battery backup thank you Amazon***",

  "cust_review": "Fantastic phone what a performance i love it.***Disclaimer : Bought Honor View20 purely for the camera. (i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow.  You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,\u00a0 1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.***It's nor worth for money.. Camera is very normal as 12MP only. Dunno in what basis they are saying it as 48MP. It's not going zoomin dept as oneplus 6T goes. Indoor pics are not that good. Even nyt shoot ll be better in vivo or oppo than this one. If anyone is going to get this mob just for a cam don't buy. It's my suggestion. Battery is gud but not as moto or one plus provides. Display is gud.***this is my initial review will post again after few weeks1) Display (6/10)- yes its a punch hole but panel quality is average2) Selfie camera(6/10) - images are soft when taken indoors.3) Rear Camera (7.5/10) - good photos in good light, hit and a miss affair in an indoor/low light situation.4) Performance (9/10) is very good , no lags.5) There is a vibration felt in the phone when talking to someone, feels hollow inside.6) Sound output via earphones is good but not great7) Speakers are average.30k would have justified the cost for this phone but 38k its not worth.***Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.1. Look is stunning2. Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch3. Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.4. Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.5. Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.6 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)7. Sound is good, not too awesome.And You can not add external microphone in honor 20 while recording a video. But in other androids, you can add the same easily.Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) . Revised reviewThanksSiddharth Arora***Used it for more than 2 hours, the display looks great with punch hole technology. Battery life and camera are things which are yet to be tested by me. I will update this review after 2 days of use.So far so good***Better then 6t***Just now i got mobile... Excellent performance,  sounds and camera are awesome. I will post after usage of other spec.***",

When i set the battery by adding a SIM card in it, and try to switch it on, it starts, but by pressing any key it goes switch off. after so many times, i found that the battery get disconnected by pressing any keys frequently any time. so you have to use this mobile like a cup of glass. If mobile pressed little bit in pocket, it goes switch off. if press the lock button little harder, mobile goes switch off. Really bad device if you wont get a proper model or tough body mobile. I have asked for replacement, lets see what my luck will say on replaced mobile. Otherwise i definitely ask for refund. All the best to new buyers.***Do not buy. The battery life is less than 7 months. After 6 months it is not even coming for one phone call. The bad part is that they give battery warranty only for 6 months. I bought to help my mom, but it ended up as a discomfort. Now i need to find another phone.Speaker phone quality is bad. Senior cannot hear at all :(. Only plus is the key pad which is big. Rest is all zero.***Excellent phone for senior citizens. Got it for my mom and she's very happy using it. She hasn't used the SoS feature etc but the speed dial and big buttons are so handy. This is the review after using it for two months!***Useless Mobile quality, stopped working frequently. Giving pain and tension to SR. Citizen.  That's reason product return Window is 15 days. It don't work and most unreliable phone. Just wasted money.***Seniorworld Easyfone is an excellent product matched with equal service support from the seniorworld . I brought this product for my senior citizen mother who is 80 years with multiple problems of parkinson, hearing problem and arthiritis and usual age related ailments ( loneliness - esp after the loss of her companion of 56 years a few years back. Easyfone has become her second best companion after me her son with whom she can keep in touch with with it's better speech quality and easy big digit pad and clock etc. In her over eagerness to keep the phone charged always she has been keeping it plugged on always which led to the battery going bad on the 11th month of the one year warranty. One call to the Seniorworld executive at gurgaon the battery was replaced without extra charge and even though I had purchased it through amazon. I recommend this simple easyfone a must have all senior elders at home.SeniorWorld Senior Citizen Friendly Easyfone (Black)***I Love the phone, Delivered in my friend\u2019s house and brought it here in Saudi Arabia ahead of the said delivery date, Good for the elderly  and I can\u2019t wait to Bring this in the Philippines and  give to my Uncle.***This phone is basically for uneducated and very old age persons. They can't read English. There is no Telugu language. An educated elder person can use smartphone. It is very difficult to operate. No shortcut options. Sos function is not working properly, it is repeatedly calling sos numbers until we turn off sos.***My search for phone with large keys and legible font ended as soon as I found easyfone..I'm glad that I bought not one but 3 phones..Elders in my family loved it ..They enjoy the radio feature and are also glad to listen to old and devotionl songs with the help of dedicated micro sd card (slot provided)Cradle charger enables them to simply place the phone in it rather than going through the trouble of finding a small charger point..Overall I definitely recommend it as I said I purchased 3 phones..Big thank you and \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d***",

Even htc own proprietary tools doesnt perform well.. The only thing we liked in this product is its build quality. expect that all other areas are very disappointing. Don't go for this product. Because you can get better than this product in the same price tag.***After One month of Usage review.Phone was good, Camera quality was average.Battery life is okay. Compared to Moto E5 Plus, this phone was good.Only con is Price of Mobile is tooooo high when compared to other Chinese Brands..***This is used one, some txt messages are entered in this mobile but original sealed packing is not opened. Very worst product***The flashlight stopped working as well asbthe front camera flashlight stopped working after 17 days.***Very fast and easy to use build quality is so good***I got it in exchange of my old moto with a very good bargain.

  "cust_review": "Phone suffers from a design flaw probably. It was faced globally. The voice is not at all audible on outgoing calls sometimes.Although Moto brought out a fix for this in other countries, Indian version still has same issue.Other than that, it is a bit overpriced.Quite user friendly thoughShould be made under Android One***Got this phone as part of festival deal at very reasonable price. Little disappointed with the stock Google on it. Migrated from Lenovo K4 Note to Moto G6 Plus and completely missing the features provided by Lenovo utilities. Camera outer lining started decoloring in 2 weeks due to engraved camera. External SD card cannot be used as adoptive memory to extend internal memory which was available in Lenovo phone. Photos on Lenovo K4 Note are better then this phone. Many other little features missing on this phone.***Always a Moto loyalist...this is the 6th gen of moto in my home. Only not very happy with the camera quality , had been using the Moto X Play n the camera was awesome.Very very disappointed with this phone.The backcase cracked with a small drop. Even the cheapest phone has never to deal with a cracked backcase. Don't buy***FOR ALL MOTO FANs:Don't buy this.Its been 3 months running and too many problems. Its a 6GB ram phone but does not act like 6GB RAM phone. Big files like pubg, asphalt lags alot. Auto shutdown or hang happens quite offen. Internet, wifi, Bluetooth connections are all the worst. Screen is too bad. You cannot play games like pubg as You can see the spot where your thumbs touch after 2 months and it is permanent. Old moto phone i played for more than 1 year with no problem on the screen. SCREEN has too many reflections. Little light presence can cause shiny reflection on your screen so you are not able to play, watch movie. In order to avoid this you have to either switch off the light or set the brightness high. You cannot even get a good fit phone cover, back case. PRICE IS HIGH. DO NOT GO FOR THIS, MOTO, CHECK OUT OTHER MODEL. till now.  I tell you: THIS IS NO MOTO PHONE.***Got this on sale with exchange for less than half the retail price. I've owned and used Moto phones before and they're sturdy and reliable; decent performance, decent cameras, decent battery and none of the strange frustrating annoyances you sometimes get with cheaper Android phones. Motorola is one of the very few brands in the mid range that makes near vanilla Android phones- so no bloatware out of the box, no crappy UI or software skin to deal with and fast updates.Battery life should be decent; I'll update this review if it isn't. Screen is sharp and clean and bright; colours not as beautiful as a Pixel or One Plus but good enough. The charging cable is a little short, but it's USB type C so I've plenty of substitutes around the house. It comes bundled with white earphones of surprisingly reasonable quality and 3 pairs of replacement cups.My only complaint is that the phone itself is a little too big and heavy, but nothing you can't get used to. About the same dimensions as a One Plus 5. Overall an excellent phone for the money. Will do 80% of what flagships do and 100% of what most people who buy flagships want from their phones anyway.***It is definitely not a \"Bang for the Buck\" kinda product. It does feels premium than any other device under 16k. Plus does have a USB Type C. It does lagged a bit on Android Oreo (8) but after Android Pie (9) update it is smooth. The Snapdragon 630 is a bit outdated processor but still does the job with quite ease.Build:Glass with aluminium build. The only thing which bothers me is the Sim Tray! It is so plasticy. But doesn't matter if you don't frequently ejecting and swapping sims.Display:It is not bad.Camera:A good one in the daylight. But great in the low light situation. Supports 4K 30fps Video recording but doesn't have EIS. 1080p 60fps is also available but no EIS there. 1080p 30fps has the EIS.Battery:Great for a 3200Mah Battery. Not outstanding or bad. It does last for a day unless yours is defective. And plus it charges up in less than 1.2Hrs.Performance:It is a SD630 with 6 gigs of ram and apps runs smoothly. Can only play PUBG in lowest settings as default. But if you use GFX Tool can run PUBG on HD settings and 60fps with almost no lag. It'd be butter smooth in 30fps or medium settings.Cons:Everything is not built for everyone. It is a bit slippery due to the glass build. But the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 does a good job against scratches. It is a bit longer than usual competition but the width is good for grabbing in one hand. (BTW I don't recommend it to people with small hands and rough usage). Camera bumb is a little bulgy than usual moto phones, but you can always place it facing upside down. And it helps to protect it against scratches.Conclusion:It is has a good build but a older processor. If you are looking for a premium looking phone for under 16k it does it well. You can play pubg on low to hd settings without any issues. The major issue with this phone was its pricing (23k @ launch) and it got many criticism due to the price to performance ratio. But now (2-02-2019) it is under 16k. For this price it is a good choice but definitely not for everyone product.***Awesome phone with all the features on offer.Pros -PerformanceBatteryDisplayLooksSounds mind-blowingCamera average, but good in this price rangeConsFront firing single speaker is not too loud and it is not too low either.Camera bump could have been avoidedVibration is not too good to be noticed, one may end up losing calls or notification due to low sound and vibrationOverall it is a good and sturdy product.***There was a problem in this phone but at the day I can't get replacement***",

  "cust_review": "After using for 7 months, battery got swelled. I've not kept it for over charge, not felled on the ground and in water but it got swelled. I talked with MI technician , they didn't gave proper reason for swelling of this battery but talked about 6 months warranty.  I'm not happy with technician's explanation about it.***Over heating issue. Charging take too much time and get discharged instantly.While buying MI phone make sure they have overcharging protection in that mobile. Recently we avoided one accident by switching of the mobile fully. I have call recording where they accepted that Redmi 4 64GB (One that I own) does not have over charging protection. Though mobile is still under one year warranty, I was charged RS.1356/- for new battery stating that battery has only 6 months warranty. Mi mobile user make sure you keep a close check on over heating and touch screen popping out due to same.Alert everyone before a bad news reaches us.***I am reviewing this product after 1 year of purchase. Super smart phone. Friendly features.i play high memory consumption games but never hangs ... I am very happy.1. Not but the list -battery consumption patterns when we use mobile data is very high. Drain very fast.***Ordered the phone in the first sale to put a review on our website. Here\u2019s a detailed review with pros cons and ratings. Few camera samples are also included.Pros:+ Good Build+ Nice Display+ Powerful Chipset+ Lag Free Performance+ No Heating+ 2 Day Battery+ Good Front and Rear Cameras+ Quick Charge 3.0 Supported+ Case Provided in the boxCons:- No Dedicated MicroSD Slot- No Type-C PortRatings:Design: 8/10Display: 8/10Battery: 10/10Back Camera: 9/10Front Camera: 8/10Processor: 9/10Call Quality: 9/10Face Unlock and Fingerprint: 9/10Sound from Speakers: 9/10Sound from Earphones: 8/10Pricing: 9/10Overall Rating: 9/10Detailed Review:Here\u2019s what you get inside the box:1. Handset2. Charger (5V 2A)3. USB charging cable4. Sim ejector pin5. Translucent CaseDesign:The design of Note 6 Pro same as that of Note 5 Pro so nothing special here. The build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. Rating 8/10.Display:The display on the front is a Full HD 6.3-inch notch display with 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. It is covered with a 2.5D glass which gives it a premium look. The notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. I think Xiaomi could have done a bit better here. Big notches mean less space for notification icons so that\u2019s not great. Rating 8/10.Battery:The phone comes with a 4000 mAh battery which is also same as Note 5 Pro. So, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. One nice improvement in Note 6 Pro is that Quick Charge 3.0 is available now. The phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. Rating 10/10.Audio:The speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. The audio via the earphone is average if you don\u2019t tweak the settings. So, I\u2019d recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. Rating 8.5/10.Performance:The Note 6 Pro runs on same Snapdragon 636. Snapdragon 636 is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. App opens and close fast. Gaming is smooth as well. If you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 6GB RAM variant. Rating 8.5/10.Security:Both fingerprint sensor and face unlock work well on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate while the Face unlock takes a bit of time (less than a second) to unlock the device. Face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so don\u2019t use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. Rating 9/10.Pricing:The pricing of Note 6 Pro was a bit of a surprise because Note 5 Pro price was increased from 13999 to 14999 and the Note 6 Pro packs some nice improvements over the 5 Pro so a price increase of 1000 was expected. But instead, Xiaomi launched it at 1000 less i.e. 13999 which is good pricing. If there was no Realme 2 Pro or Honor 8X then price would have been 15999 for sure. Rating: 9/10.Camera:When Redmi Note 5 Pro launched earlier this year, it had one of the best camera in its price range and now Note 6 Pro comes with an improved camera. The aperture and pixel size has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. In earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations.The front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. The performance of front camera is good as well. Pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. The dynamic range wasn\u2019t great though.The camera is impressive. Few camera samples are included in this review, more samples will be added on the final review on our website. Rating 8.5/10.SummaryOverall, Redmi Note 6 Pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 13999, we think it offers good value for money. If you have a budget of around 15000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then Note 6 Pro should be your choice.If you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X are good options.If you already have the Note 5 Pro, then you should skip the Note 6 Pro as it is not that big of an upgrade.Which Color is the best?If you like to keep things simple, then go for the Black color. If you need something bright and flashy then go for the Blue color which looks really nice.I hope you liked the review. If it was helpful, please give thumbs-up/upvote.***I purchased this phone on 23rd of December 2017 and writing this review on 15th December 2108. For the last couple of months, my mi 4 is giving problems. Phone rings but screen sometimes doesn't come alive. Finger print unlocking is very slow, sometimes it takes more than a minute to wake up. If you are in any sort of emergency and need to call, it may deceive you.***Product is smart and it shows good phone on your smart hand but one disappointed out of 4GB RAM 2GB are under inbuilt apps it's not fair deal because only can user decided what app is useful for me and what not....... overall phone is good and performance are better........it's only by name of MI......it's my second MI phone and experience with MI is excellent.***Received the product today.... very disappointed. The phone had a defect because of which I was unable to unlock the phone the buttons 789 would not press\u2639\ufe0f. Amazon has agreed to replace but I lost all the fun and excitement of buying a new phone.***I have used HTC Mobiles earlier, bought this mobile in sep.2017 for last 6 months I am in trouble. It has good space of 64gb even though hang while using most of the times. Whenever I tried to reboot or switch-off the handset, I was unable to completely switch off or On at once. next, u can't open or detach its battery. Worst experience.***",

I have been through all the reviews and then I was so sure that yes i really should order this and , i am so happy with my choice now.Product review:1. Battery life: I was not sure with this thing when I bought it; but believe me this product I have is better in terms of battery life than my android (coolpad note 3). Can go 2 days with normal usage  on a single go.2. Picture quality: It is so amazing. I have been using it for my YT videos. And I found no problem at all .3. Hang issue: None yet4. Money: I got it for 34k , when it comes to apple; they do charge a lot. But believe me with this they provides lot of good quality as well.And if you are reading this , you sure don\u2019t have money issues.5. Apps: I didn\u2019t pay for a single app untill the day, and forget what other says , apple is amazing .Conclusion:Buy this product for sure, dont worry about model ; 6s is forever. Not too expensive like x series and still have all the features.Hope this will help.Let me know if you need more help.***My headset and charger were duplicates..can someone help me getting the original one***The good things about the iPhone 6s: Camera is excellent in the daylight, 3D-touch is butter smooth, good sound quality, look wise a perfect piece, battery charges very quickly, and also earphone sound is very good and so many good security and other features which I Ioved in the iPhone.The bad thing is only the battery, which is average (1 day for the average user). Overall a good purchase, go for it in a GIF.***Very good camera quy***Had purchased this phone to gift my wife on 1st Feb 2019. On 2nd Feb 2019 got some disturbance of network occurs. We though it could be a network problem. So We wait for it & tried with different networks calling from different location where other phones were working fine. But unfortunately issues was still there.We contacted Amazon as it was under 10 days replacement policy directly from Amazon. They guided us to visit service center to get job deny job sheet from them ( according to them it was a standard process & guidelines from Apple).ALthough it was very painful to visit service center just after three days of purchase of this handset. But we did it. After getting inspection from them they told us that there is no issue with device but problem is with sim card, although it was the same sim which we were using earlier in small keypad phone ( sound & network were amazing at my home & other locations).but still we changed sim card & used it for some days, but issue is still there.As per amazon we have to get job deny job sheet from Apple. As per Apple they wont give it as it can be repair after open the set.But how  can i allow them to open the set within three days of purchase.It is very painful, this is my third purchase of iPhone from Amazon. We never expect these kind irresponsible response from Amazon & Iphone both.We are not purchasing any Iphone from Amazon from now onward.***Really awesome phone... and original mobile... thanxxxx amazon and apple... camera result is awesome...***Super product and quick and safe deliveryFuffy satisfied***A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great.***",

The Good build quality.***When I'm at home, I use WiFi. When I step out of the house and I don't have WiFi, I expect 4G to kick in. This doesn't happen on this phone. Or when I'm on 4G and then I move to some place where 4G isn't available, the Internet obviously wouldn't work. But when I am back to a place, 4G data is supposed to kick in automatically. This doesn't happen either. I don't know if it's a faulty device or it's something with Samsung. But I am seriously disappointed. Have put in request for a replacement.***only one thing i liked in this item that is back camera front camera not like 32mp the most bad thing in this item it's battery it's draining so fastly.If there is 6Gb ram so we are obviously buying it for playing high speed game but without installing anything battery draining so fast i don't like this phone at all i promise i never ever purchase in future samsung phone***- Camera quality is low- Phone is bloated with Samsung crap-ware which can't be uninstalled- FingerPrint sensor doesn't work correctly. To unlock the phone I have to try 4-5 times, Every-Time! And even sometime I have to enter the password.- Display doesn't seem very good***Camera quality is impressive  but fingerprint touch for unlock is so slow***When Comparing to VIVO V15 Pro this Samsung Galaxy A70 is much better. As VIVO V15 Pro is having Drawbacks as Mobile hangs many times, More Heating Issue, No Battery backup as it lasts for 1 Hour 30 Minutes Only. Camera Quality is also Average. I think this VIVO V15 Pro should be priced under 15K.***",

  "cust_review": "Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***",

The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.***1st day mobile is dead and service centre reopen phone but hang problem and slow processing also faced***This is my first phone from samsung after apple x and this phone is great as compared to display quality and camera quality ..also has fast fingerprint BUT face recogintion is bit slower than iphone xI recommend to all to purchase as its worth for single penny***The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds.***S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.***Just bought it today at 9pm of 9th March from my friends mobile shop ...but after using it for 1 hour phone is stopped working it's not turning on not even charging I tried to reboot it how's my friend is telling me but it's not even showing me any single point on screen...it was my first Samsung phone but worked only for 1 hour worst experience ever ...***",

The buttons are smooth and came with full battery. Will review once I insert sim & SD card. For now, the phone is good.

  "prod_des": "A7 adopts the industry-first water drop screen design, backed by several technological advances, reflecting nature like a water droplet on the verge of dropping. Corning glass supports an 88.4 percent screen ratio, providing resistance to scratches, while offering a more immersive experience. We apply the concept of contrasting beauty in aesthetics to product design, bringing together two trendy colours, Glaring Gold and Glaze Blue. A first in the industry, the 3D heat-curved sheet and grating pattern on the back mirrored texture casing creates a premium look, in concert with the polished feel in the central frame. Anti-reflective coating is added to the A7 to increase the overall screen brightness by 35 percent - the view looks good whichever angle you look at. Also, a low-voltage backlight reduces the phone temperature by 0.5 \u00b0C while a magnesium alloy allows the battery to dissipate heat more efficiently. All these efforts contributes to a better handgrip. A huge 4230mAh battery capacity frees you from the concern of battery drain during your day. Moreover, smart and thoughtful AI battery management freezes inactive apps and reduces excess caching to save more power.",

  "cust_review": "Hi Everyone, it\u2019s my sincere suggestion NOT to buy this phone. I purchased this less than a month ago. Haven\u2019t installed any major 3rd party apps and still this phone is troubling me. It shuts down automatically and then it becomes a huge problem to restart this phone because everytime you restart it, it switches off again that very moment. At this very time when I am writing the review, the phone is not even restarting now. My money is wasted. This phone is not worth buying. Don\u2019t waste your hard earned money on this phone.***I am a fan of Moto G series mainly due to its durability and have been using it since its introduction. But Moto E5 Plus disappointed me badly. A minor drop on the floor resulted in a damaged screen within one month of purchase. The 5000mAh battery also started draining very quickly within the same period even with normal usage. There are a no of other brands available for the same price, so choose wisely.***Mobile has hang issue and front camera quality is bad and it hang during the phase change.i.e. from back to front camera. phone heats during the call and charging . I requested to amazon for return but they are denying for return.Only one option I have to go to consumer court.***Nice product.Good mobile Excellent.***Screen cracked automatically***Battery drain very quick,it didn't last even 5hrs but in the add its showing that 18hrs of playback time. Lol \ud83e\udd23....Other draw backs.1.Rapid charging ( just for attention only never mind) even it takes more than 6hrs to charge to get 100%*note when the phone is off.2.face detection wont work and about the finger print reader,may be work some times like oru indian govt. \ud83d\ude053.lock buttons & Volume buttons in wrong position.4.I bought this phone on 27th nov and returned back , The funny thing is it didn't even detect the sim card ,networks ,and even wifi .... Hihi***I've been using this mobile for more than a month now. It is very handy. I love big phones with good camera and this phone really suits my need. The storage capacity and the power of the battery makes it a best phone than the ones I've been using before.***Highly satisfied with its performance till date and its Battery Life***",

I wanna say that this piece here gives you more that what you pay. if you use mi phone you can use the enhancer and add in extra bass. I used spotify equalizer and mi equalizer together and the bass was soo deep. the earphones handled it really well. also you can't hear anything else than the music. the design is just awesome. buy the red one. looks awesome. the quality is just right. right for the price. for this price I'd recommended this. I'm a bass lover. at first I was like ok. but then I'm satisfied now***Absolutely cool product considering the price range. Sound quality is 8/10 and build quality is trendy. But unfortunately i had to approach the service centre as my headphone started malfunctioning after 2 months. The left speaker and the mic was not working anymore. But after getting a new one as a replacement i am quite satisfied with the product. Its been 7 months i am using the product yet no issues. After several tests i got a final conclusion about the malfunctioning of the headphone. This headphone is specifically made for Android devices. If u somehow use with your loving laptop and any device for a single time u gonna damage it. Dont know why this happens but its true. So use it only on your android phones and enjoy the deep bass of this amazing headphone. For any queries contact me sajukaif@gmail.com***Nit a good product! Mine stopped working with in 1st month of purchase! And now iam struggling with warranty claim!***This product amazed me.i was so shocked by its sound quality.trust me freind i have used many other earphones under 1200 like,skull candy,jbl,senhieser,sony all the earphones i bought it above 800 and this mi  i bought only for 399 and m telling u freind this earphone is far far better than those above earphone.just buy it,i am asurering 100% that u'll not regret it. I just bought it yesterday so i can't say about durability.***After using for over a month now it's one speaker is not working. Tried calling Mi they have advised to contact Amazon. Amazon has no provision for exchange after a certain period. Don't know to whom to contact. A poor quality headset and l do not know about how I can go without invoice. Please Amazon help me to get the invoice.***I bought this earphone for my gym purpose and within one month it stopped working properly. Got it replaced and now the replaced one is working good untill now (just 1week passed) . I hope the replaced one would last long.Sound is nice. Bass is quite good compared to boat extra bass. You need to tweak equilizer to get excellent output. I own a Xiaomi phone so no issue for me.In short good output at this price but durability is a issue.***",

  "cust_review": "After using a smartphone for a little too many days and being stuck in constant distractions, I've traded in my smartphone for this dumb phone, and I've been so happy with this decision. The OS is simple and lag free, basic functions like the camera and music player work as expected. The music player is a little too bare-bones for my liking but it's still passable at this price. Call quality is good, battery life is pretty good as well, and it recognises 4G sim cards albeit it doesn't really support 4G call quality or even the internet!Overall this phone is great for minimalists, the elderly, or really anyone looking for a digital detox.***I bought if for my father and from next day on wards it is automatically switching off in every 4-5 minutes. He could not use it and is very upset and frustrated. We have place the order to replace it.  I feel the old NOKIA is no more....that quality gone. I will recommend not to buy it.***OK if all you want is a basic feature phone for voice calls and messaging. Voice quality is not really great - so may not be useful for seniors. Phone finish and looks are average.***I chose Nokia over others for simple UI, its durability, quality and battery backup based on  performance of my old Nokia basic phones which even today are functioning without any flaws. But since Nokia has handed over its  handset production  to HMD global the quality of Nokia products especially feature phones have declined. This product Nokia 150 disappoints in every aspect like battery backup (3-4 days max in standby and 2 days if you do some calling and  play music ),camera quality(even  jiophone has better quality ,Nokia 150 will capture ghost out of you) and every thing for which i purchased it. At same or cheaper price other companies are offering better features like inbuilt call recorder , 3000mah battery with power bank feature. what is use of durability when performance is poor. I do not recommend it for basic phone user. Go for Samsung if you are using 2G network or better go for jiophone (which i have tried and tested).Regarding the  seller i.e Appario retail, they didn't mention any of the two IMEI Numbers without  which warranty can't be claimed instead they have mentioned  one IMEI number in 'order summary' where it has been clearly written that it can not be presented as an invoice. Such carelessness from highly rated seller. Soon will contact Amazon cust. Care. For that and for future purchases of mobile handsets, i will make sure before buying that seller mentions atleast one IMEI no. In tax invoice or serial no. in cade of other electronic items.Thanks.***This was classified as a Sr. Citizen mobile and I purchased it for an elderly person. While the mobile is good, simple operation, etc. IT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS A SENIOR CITIZEN MOBILE - THE KEYS ARE TOO SMALL, SCREEN FONT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER, THERE IS NO SINGLE TOUCH DIALING AND NO DISTRESS CALL BUTTON. DISAPPOINTED SINCE THIS IS BEING TOUTED AS A SR. CITIZEN MOBILE BY ALL.***this is an excellent basic phone. I bought it for my mother. Using the phone is quiet easy. battery back up is excellent overall phone can be recommend for new purchase***I'm fully satisfied with my new Nokia 150 . It withstand my all the expectation. But don't expect a lot from it as Nokia can't give a lot of features in this price it. It's rings for few seconds and then the call gets rejected. camera is of standard quality .These were the only drawbacks of this phone, otherwise the phone is fabulous and gives that nostalgic feeling like other Nokia phones give.***I am using small phone besides my smartphone. My old nokia got damaged after 6 yrs so i opted for nokia again. But when compared to quality with old nokia its not standing anywhere. Very disaapointing from Nokia. Functions which were simple made complicated.***",

  "cust_review": "Fantastic phone with its fit and finish. Works flawlessly. Am using it for intercom of the building which means that it is used several times a day since I bought it. The LED lights glow whence is being used and when there is an incoming call. The buttons have a great tactile feel and easy for any size of fingers to be used. The sound quality is great and has consistently worked well since a year now. The phone is compact and light weight, does not use much space for its placement. Works well in narrow spaces. The combination of metal & plastic used is good, so is the finish which doesn\u2019t show any deterioration at all after using for 1 year. Strongly recommended product.***badddd! just looks nice; but once you start using u realize that its so light in weight that the whole phone comes up with the receiver:-)...also wall hanging doesnt work coz the handset falls off...thats so so stupid design. there is no lock to keep the handset in place.DON'T BUY!!!***The phone is good but the photos here can be quite misleading. The photos here have been adjusted and the colors look more vivid. It's not as brown as it appears and in fact the earpiece is more copper colored than bronze.The phone quality is fine, light weight. On time delivery as well. Led works well when the phone rings or when the earpiece is lifted. Three stars bevause I bought this based on the colour so that it matches the decor of my house. And it doesn't.***Nice economical phone.Purchased for intercom and works good.Pro's - Good look  Melt with furniture decor  Blue led light while using  Soft dial padCons - China made i.e body looks good but not solid  So light weight that moves hear and there while in use.***Love this phone. Wooden textured body looks great, led light is beautiful. Sound is crystal clear. Has an option to keep the phone suspended on wall too. Perfect for intercom. Can be used as a regular landline phone too.***Product atractive and butifull good but buttans not working.....don't purchase this product.....***While this instrument looks good, the mouthpiece stopped working after a couple of weeks. Basically you can hear but the other person will not be able to hear you. There was no mishandling at all***Good sound quality. Average weight, happy with the size and colour of the phone. It\u2019s same as explained by the seller. I bought this phone as my antique look phone stopped working due to lightning. This is a temporary replacement until I get another good antique look phone. Very happy with the purchase and and Amazons amazing delivery.***",

  "cust_review": "Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***",

Missing some apps like Gallery.. but inbuilt file manager was the great replacement... G series is always outstanding.... But charger was not so good as compared to g3 charger.... Awesome sounds system....***From One day phone is giving some other problem, unable to download apps from play store. Now unable to hear voice while on call.

The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.***1st day mobile is dead and service centre reopen phone but hang problem and slow processing also faced***This is my first phone from samsung after apple x and this phone is great as compared to display quality and camera quality ..also has fast fingerprint BUT face recogintion is bit slower than iphone xI recommend to all to purchase as its worth for single penny***The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds.***S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.***Just bought it today at 9pm of 9th March from my friends mobile shop ...but after using it for 1 hour phone is stopped working it's not turning on not even charging I tried to reboot it how's my friend is telling me but it's not even showing me any single point on screen...it was my first Samsung phone but worked only for 1 hour worst experience ever ...***",

The worst part of the service center visit is they don't understand that the mobile is getting hang, the technical person told that that's how it will work. Even scrolling up or down is not smoth..... just because spent 15k looks we have to live with this mobile, nobody taking responsibility and no proper answer as well....felt very bad with this purchase***Bad camera quality....Dont like at all***phone look nice camera evarage battery  avarage***Value for money.Lg lovers must buy this.***Was hanging very often and touch was not very sensitive.***",

  "cust_review": "Received my phone in the morning today. Pretty happy with the way it has behaved since. A few pointers.1. The phone got ridiculously hot initially. The battery was also draining like crazy at that time. I then realised that I had forgotten to remove the plastic around the sides of the phone. Things got a lot better after I removed it. But I am still seeing a considerable battery drain.2. The front camera goes into overdrive in order to make you beautiful. While there may be a few people who like it, I for one think that it completely spoils a photo. I hope Samsung improves this in future software updates.That's it! Everything else about this phone is top notch! I love the display, back cameras (both lenses), and overall ergonomics of this device. It's probably half an inch taller than iPhone 6,but it's oh so better looking! Even the UI has improved drastically since my S7 edge days.I'll post an update regarding the batter life after a week. Devices do usually tend to drain battery initially when the owner is over enthusiastic and the phone is still learning the usage patterns.Update 1 (after using for two weeks):Battery life: The battery drain issue has almost completely gone away. I'm consistently getting over 5 hours of screen on time throughout the day. A few settings had to be tweaked, but I reckon it was more about the phone learning my habits and adapting accordingly.Cameras: I got a software update that significantly improved the quality of front camera. With the rear cameras already brilliant, I am now satisfied with the overall camera performance. Be informed that the picture quality under low light settings is still not as terrific as that from the Pixel 3. The photos are very very good, but not as good s those from Pixel 3.Other observations: OneUI is absolutely amazing. I've used multiple OnePlus devices, S7 Edge, and Google phones in the past, but this is the most practical implementation of android out there. Also, it give you to option to experiment with tonnes of customizations.This should be your next phone.***Its look similar to iPhone XVery handyVery classyOther features will be added after usage of time...After using for almost 3 months im still affectionate to this device. Still this divice working so smooth and fine..Best phone as compared to iphone X..***If you want a classy phone then go for this one.The cam is so good that phones like one plus 6 will not stand anywhere.Ppl will ask only u to pull your phone out for pics.The feel of the phone is great.Picture quality is great.There are many new features and I would highly recommend buying this.***In this way, the S10e (\u2018e\u2019 for \u2018essential\u2019) is a lot like the Apple iPhone XR, and it\u2019s hard not to see Samsung\u2019s as the \u2018budget flagship\u2019 of the iPhone XS line: both pack the best parts of their generation in a phone that\u2019s not quite as svelte or feature-rich as their pricier siblings.There are compromises for that lower cost, of course. The S10e doesn\u2019t get some of some of the neat features in its pricier siblings, like an in-screen fingerprint sensor, curved screen sides or a telephoto lens. These sorts of features will undoubtedly show up in more handsets in 2019, so it\u2019ll be curious to see if their exclusion gives you flagship phone envyBut we doubt you\u2019ll be too jealous. The Galaxy S10e is a lovely one-hand-friendly phone that with top-of-the-line specs to match. Its 5.8-inch all-screen display is easy to hold and its chipset is fast enough that it\u2019ll compete with other flagships for years to come, even if its compromises in display resolution and camera fall short of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus.***Phone is great, no doubt. Best option if you are looking for a small, handy phone. Fits perfectly in my hand. However, battery life is just horrible. I start with 100% at 7am and it drops to 15% by 7pm (Wifi, 4G on; location, bluetooth off, medium power saving). Takes 2 hours to fully charge. Very disappointed with battery. I had a onePlus 3 (2016) before this which gave me 16-18 hours on a charge and took just 40 minutes to fully charge. This level of low battery performance was not expeceted from Samsung. Rest everything is great.***First impression has passed.***Battery drain very quickly and some heating issues....Very poor battery by Samsung...not expected this type of quality by Samsung at this price range......pls don't purchase***I was a regular user of Galaxy S series and used it till S6 stage. Later I moved to other brands. However with S10e I came back and it is very good decision indeed.  S10e is most operable phone, just right size to hold, talk and watch the screen. It is having excellent screen quality and very good camera quality. It is fast, without any lag and with reasonably good storage and RAM. My initial experience with it is very good.***",

  "cust_review": "NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7\") and XR the biggest(6.1\"), with X and XS with same size(5.8\"), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps.***Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.***Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon***So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there\u2019s a glitch in the front camera\u2019s portrait mode. That\u2019s fine, it may happen. But what\u2019s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!***It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I\u2019m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.***The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you.***Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon***",

  "cust_review": "Always wanted to have a Nokia set. So when my iphone 5S' fell down n finally stopped working, I had to purchase a budget Phone. So ordered it. Now its only three days and already I am regretting. Go for anyother brand but Nokia. Disappointed with many things but would like to mention specially about the camera. No clarity in the clicks. In night you can't take good pictures. Even 4-5 years before launched samsung phone has better cameras and pictures quality.***The Nokia always king maker and king of all phones. And it's Zeiss optics fantastic combination. Its all material are real. The NOKIA PHONE is fast learner of using person. In my hand it feels me proud like YES NOKIA IS WITH ME GREAT. From poor to richest it is FRIEND of all. Nokia \u2764\ufe0f (hater's please shutdown blaming. In God vs ghost , hero vs villan, good vs bad , true and lie , in these more powerful is ghost ,villan , bad , lier But ALWAYS WINNER AND SUCCESS Is GOD , HERO , GOOD AND TRUE like Nokia \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\udc2f)***Very nice.... Strongly recommend for all viewers...1 body is so much nice that you can't deny and nice finishing2 bettery is also good3 camera is above average4 sound is fantastic.5 display is awesomeBut heating problem is there***Excellent build qualityDisplay at rich color and clear even though 720p resolutionStock Android which gives monthly security patch and updatesSize is comfortable and tidy sidesbest camera performance for this price rangeCharging speed is quite highwe can use external memory card as internal up to 256GbVoLTE supportAnd it's NOKIA ( bcoz they seem to improve their products to get the market )***I have bought this set 3 months before only .. n it is showing storage space problem since one month... Though I haven't installed extra apps... Still day by day the problem is increasing... N I don't want to reset my phone time n again . Apart from this... It irritates with many system updates. I request Nokia to please help me with this problem.***Won't recommend due to handful of reasons1. Battery life poor2. Much better mobiles available in the same budget3. Even if the mobile is on sound mode, it does not gives any sound when a message, mail, what app etc. Comes***For touch and feel the phone looks good, when it comes to the performance after one year use it seems battery drains quickly some time it hangs and dont ask for the camera quality... over all the phone is below the average compared to the other products in the market at same price....***The box containing the phone looks like it was lying in thrash can, the phone is clearly not new. After opening, kept the phone for charging while off, it heated up so much i couldn't even hold it. Either i got a defective piece or the phone itself sucks...Return/replacement not allowed until phone temp reaches 45 degrees, in the presence of a technician or some dumb app they use to check temp over a call. 9k wasted... :(***",

Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps.***Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.***Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon***So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there\u2019s a glitch in the front camera\u2019s portrait mode. That\u2019s fine, it may happen. But what\u2019s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!***It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I\u2019m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.***The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you.***Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon***",

  "cust_review": "Fantastic phone what a performance i love it.***Disclaimer : Bought Honor View20 purely for the camera. (i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow.  You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,\u00a0 1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.***It's nor worth for money.. Camera is very normal as 12MP only. Dunno in what basis they are saying it as 48MP. It's not going zoomin dept as oneplus 6T goes. Indoor pics are not that good. Even nyt shoot ll be better in vivo or oppo than this one. If anyone is going to get this mob just for a cam don't buy. It's my suggestion. Battery is gud but not as moto or one plus provides. Display is gud.***this is my initial review will post again after few weeks1) Display (6/10)- yes its a punch hole but panel quality is average2) Selfie camera(6/10) - images are soft when taken indoors.3) Rear Camera (7.5/10) - good photos in good light, hit and a miss affair in an indoor/low light situation.4) Performance (9/10) is very good , no lags.5) There is a vibration felt in the phone when talking to someone, feels hollow inside.6) Sound output via earphones is good but not great7) Speakers are average.30k would have justified the cost for this phone but 38k its not worth.***Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.1. Look is stunning2. Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch3. Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.4. Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.5. Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.6 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)7. Sound is good, not too awesome.And You can not add external microphone in honor 20 while recording a video. But in other androids, you can add the same easily.Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) . Revised reviewThanksSiddharth Arora***Used it for more than 2 hours, the display looks great with punch hole technology. Battery life and camera are things which are yet to be tested by me. I will update this review after 2 days of use.So far so good***Better then 6t***Just now i got mobile... Excellent performance,  sounds and camera are awesome. I will post after usage of other spec.***",

The Video is too shaky even if the hands are steady.2)WIFI : The wifi chip is too weak and disconnects at low signals and has a poor download and upload speed.3)Selfie Flash is not too bright and the auto mode in selfie light does not work properlyMy Samsung j5 prime keeps the lowest signal connected.***Purchased this product total waste of your money ..within 10 days Continuously restart issue.service centre not able to find solution..after complaint tollfree they are not ready to replace New.they simply convey to wait 10 days for board replacement..not at all satisfy this product as they mention spec and quality also..***+ Really good phone under 10K range.+ Camera performance is also impressive and much better then other competitive phones.+ Total Package.***Honor 7c is one of the handsets that fits the price range and truly justifies for what you payFront camera is good for selfiesBack camera is good but as I am I phone user surely the pic quality does not match to that levelSound is very good you can enjoy movies on the goWatching movies on this large screen is really awsmeBattery life is too good as I phone lacks in battery life.

  "cust_review": "The reason for buying Nokia 3.1 is primarily due to my two requirements: 1. stock Android, 2. small screen size. Moto G6 & E5 were dropped due to larger screen.\u2022 Phone size is ideal for single-handed use. It is sleek and feels good to hold.\u2022 Stock Android running 8.0. 3GB RAM plus lack of bloatware will help in smooth performance in the long run.\u2022 Blue/Copper colour looks better than the black version. Copper ring around the front panel looks classy.\u2022 Available internal storage is about 22GB. Dual sim + micro SD card.\u2022 Camera is decent. Highest video recording is HD 1080p for rear camera & HD 720p for front. Slow motion & Time lapse feature.\u2022 Rear camera has a small bump.\u2022 In-built FM radio.\u2022 Built quality is good.\u2022 Battery easily lasts more than a day.\u2022 At 139gms, it is lightweight and easy to carry around.\u2022 Should have provided USB Type-C port.\u2022 When on a call, there is noticeable vibration felt on the back panel. This is mostly coming from the earpiece.\u2022 Speaker can often get covered while watching videos.\u2022 No LED notification light in the front.\u2022 Lower bezel is huge. Home/back buttons are placed on-screen. What a waste of real estate!\u2022 The side & back panels are very smooth and is prone to slippage. Case is much needed.\u2022 Should have been priced lower (MRP 12k at the time of review). For someone not particular about stock android, better options are available.***Phone was due for software update. As soon as i setup the phone i got Official OTA software upgrade prompt. Initially software update failed multiple times. Then in another try it just went into boot loop and now it will now switch on. It just restarts automatically and just shows white screen with Android One logo and restarts again. Want to return.***I just got the phone today and I am now facing technical issues with the phone. The phone automatically switches on and off. I contacted the Nokia helpline and they suggested to return the phone in Amazon. After that, I contacted the Amazon helpline and they helped me set up an appointment with a technician tomorrow. I would suggest going with other brands while buying a mobile phone. Maybe Nokia is not what it used to be. Anyway, I'll post a review after the technician visit tomorrow.***I bought this phone on 23rd Feb and received it the next day. On starting the phone, Google prompted for the latest software update. But after the update, the phone goes into an endless boot up cycle - the Android One logo keeps coming on and off over and over again. Now I am waiting for the tech guy to visit me, cant even return this phone. Not happy, not happy at all.***Okay product. Some of functions doesn't work satisfactorily. Android version is not upto mark. Too small display of icons (32 on one screen). Overall disappointed with Nokia.***I actually brought this smartphone phone for someone else. Someone not so tech-savvy. But for the price this phone offers a lot of features. The person I bought for was thrilled to have it. She wasn't expecting these many features at this price point especially from a Brand like Nokia. The build and screen quality is above par. Great battery life and timely software updates make this a great proposition. But screen size is too small I guess. That's one area one would be disappointed while considering to buy this phone. If you are tight on budget, then you should consider Nokia in your options. Nokia does offers a great value for money products.***Cons: The phone heats within 5 min of talk time.Had a discussion with Nokia chat on their support site. Nokia tech support suggests me to switch off mobile data to avoid the heating issue. I do not understand the need of purchasing a 4G phone when the suer has to switch off 4G data to use the phone.An additional suggestion from Nokia tech support is not to worry about the heating. Pathetic response.Please avoid purchasing this phone.***The phone was not functional out of the box - it got stuck in boot screen as soon as the update ran on turning on the phone and is un-usable.  While products can sometimes be defective, what is appalling is the customer service provided by Amazon.  1) In spite of a 10 day return policy advertised for defective products, Amazon refused to take it back 2) They made us jump through hoops like installing additional apps, call at very specific times before connecting with someone 3) Leave alone apologizing for a damaged product, the support technician was asking why we did not initiate return on the same day on receipt, expecting us to stop everything we are doing and set up phone as soon as package was receives. 4) Provided trouble shooting tips that demonstrated zero knowledge of product - kept asking to charge phone 5) Now - more than a week since the issue, we have to make time to meet their technician, who will spend who knows how many days on this, before *maybe* offering a replacement.  Net net - we still don't have a phone that works after a week, and have been forced to purchase another phone.Amazon has a reputation of great customer service in the US, but it is really sad to see how they treat consumers in  India.  Experiences like these are why the Indian consumer doesn't trust and hesitates to use e-commerce.I hope the Amazon India head Amit Agarwal reads this, and improves the customer experience.***",

As per the discussion I showed the phone and the bill to another Nokia service centre which is almost 75 km away from the previous one. But the wording of the Nokia service personnel is same as before that this particular model is under replacement warranty and they are not authorised to do anything. Now I would request Amazon from whom I have bought the phone to give me a solution for this. Hope you understand my problem and resolve the issue.Thanks.***Faltu phone plz dont Buy this product..even at 50%. Within one month Display Gone.poor sound Quality.After going to Service Center They denied to repair the phone coz of i brought the phone from Amazon.than after i called amazon tollfree they told to get me Denied letter.Now i have to Dance here an there?***First off this product is a Beauty. Being an old Motorola Fan, I feel Nokia has done well w.r.t. this phone design.Many may complain, that build quality is not that great, but I beg to defer.I feel the build quality is superb for its price, the display is cool, that curve is sexy.Being so used Power Thirsty Mobiles, the new 3310 was charged to 100% a couple of days' ago, and even after fiddling it, playing music, FM Radio, it still shows a full Battery. I am going to wait to see when I need to charge it next, will post that information in about a week's time.So based on the price I paid, here is my overview of the product (I am not giving the specs here, that is available on the website.)That dual SIM + microSD card option is an awesome addition to this tiny phone. I have placed a 32GB memory card in there.Excellent - Build Quality, Display, Camera, Size, Weight, Keypad, Navigation, Voice reception, and mic.Good - Inbuilt speaker, Headset.Bad - Nothing (In my opinion, have everything I need in this phone for this price)***really very very amazing phone. build quality is very good it looks like premium phone. its easy to use and it is a handy phone. in my family most of all the family members uses nokia 3310 as a secondary phone. Batteryry backup is good camera quality is also good. i use this mobile in last 1 year and i didn't face any problem or my mobile also fall on the floor many times but there is no crack in the phone or there is no scratch in the phone body. Yea the price of this phone is bitter high but if you want a premium quality phone they go with it. I Love This Phone.***I not get battery good***Got this phone for my mom who didnt want any internets or whatapps. It looks very cute. But audio is poor, and speaker quality is also poor. I expected better from this iconic phone of the 2000's.***Defective piece. Cursor key not working on pressing. Disappointed. On replacement reauest courier guy came but didnot pick up the set rather told contact amazon office***The build quality is very bad and ipurchase it after some time the  flash light is automatically stop doing then i returned it next dayMy experience is very bad.***",

Was looking for a phone with big buttons.Positives:1) Build Quality is good.2) Signal strength is excellent.  Even my smart phone (Mi Max) displays only 2 bars signals.3) Easy to use buttons and features.4) Dual Sim5) Battery backup (5 Hours - if a couple of calls are made).  Standby still not seen.6) Screen is brightNegatives.1) Non stand Charger (not the usual Micro USB charger).  Will have to go to service center to buy new one if the charger goes kaput.2) No Data Facility. Only Call and SMS Facility (What is the use of giving Dual SIM)3) Slightly tricky to connect the battery to the battery connector.4) Non standard battery (the usual three AA Battery taped together)***This is my 4 th Beetel GSM Phone. The first one i purchased was for our farmhouse which had zero Network. This Beetel phone works very well and reception is clear even with 2 signal . Seeing the reception in farmhouse my relatives also ordered and we ended up with 4 Phones.***Good alternative to mobile and wired phone.***Great product***Good product***Amazing quality and perfect look.***perfect. best for home and office***Receiver handset is not working.

  "cust_review": "A very beautiful phone with excellent hand feel. Call quality, reception, WiFi all top notch. Cameras both rear and front are very good in normal light. Wanting in night shots. AI not of much help. Hope Huawei does provide EIS with an update. A phone at this price point should offer EIS at least if not an OIS. One will miss all Missed Calls as the Notification LED remains Green whereas in much cheaper phones it turns Red and it alert doesn't remain on screen at all. One has to look in the dialler. Very irritating. Huwawei should address this immediately with an update. It's a major Con. Battery life is excellent and it easily lasts an entire day. On the whole a good phone except the above Cons a few of which can be addressed with updates and I hope Huawei doesn't disappoint. Another major Con is the absence of a Date Time Stamp in the camera which is unbelievable as even Esm2,000 feature phones have a Date Time Stamp. Hope Huawei resolves this issue immediately with an Update. I had also tweeted Huawei about the Cons and two days ago I got an OTA providing the December Security Patch and the Video Calling Facility in the Dialler. Thanks to Huawei for listening to my complaint. Hope to get EIS and Android Pie soon. Now I'm happier with the phone. The battery life is superb.***After lot of searching and review bought this mobile and now I am really happy for this product. I was confusing to buy with comparing MI A2, Nokia 6.1 plus, Vivo v9, OPPO f9 pro, honor playAfter 3 weeks usage,Design and display is awesome and crystal clearCamera is best in its range. Great camera experienceStorage 110GB freeAudio speaker quality is loud and clearNetwork connections are goodDual 4G supportCharging time is speed enough and battery backup is great. I m having around 25% at the end of the day[4g data will be on always, dual Sim, Facebook, YouTube for more than 6 hours per day, gaming for 1 hour, normal browsing]Did not face any heating issues at all. Very very little warm while making whatsapp video calls for 1 hour and watching streaming videos while chargingFace unlock and finger print lock is speed and accurateDon't take any negative reviews. You can ask questions and I will reply my experience***This phone is very good in this price range.. All features are good and phone is working very smooth.. No complaints for this... Only one thing is missing... Gorilla glass 3 protection***Really disappointed. I was having honor 6x, it was a good phone compared to this.Looks is good.Screen mirroring stops working after 15 minutes and it wont connect again if we try.Hangs a lot, Never happens with my Honor 6x never. My mom redmi 5 2gb ram is good with basic stuff. Waste of money.***Phone has some good features at the price point. Camera during the daylight produces some great pictures. It struggles a bit in the artificial lighting indoors. That's the only drawback I've noticed.Quality of the speaker is just not good. At this price range they could have given a better in built speaker. (Well that's not a deal breaker though)Battery took me by a surprise. It sustained more than a day for me on continuous use of 4g and WiFi.. good job on the battery though.. credit goes to the processor which is power efficient..***AWSOME phone by Huawei. I am already using Honor3c Honoring and Honor 6 phone by Huawei. Build quality is too good. I used Honor 6 for almost 4.5 years and then I bought this phone. This phone is like butter. Touch is so responsive like knife in the butter. Recommend everybody to buy this phone. Instead of Samsung and Apple which to me is waste of money. Whereas in very less money you get very good specs and quality phone.***Picture quality is good, no issues with sound and battery life is great. Happy with the phone***It's been just one month I bought this phone . Couple of days back it accidentally slipped from my hand (which is a normal fall for any phone ) but the screen broke and display I can see vertical lines . This phone is very delicate. The insurance guy who came to collect the phone informed me that he had collected the same model from others with the same issue . Hopefully I will go for exchange once my current screen issue is fixed .***",

  "cust_review": "The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering \"mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money\". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime. In then situation, when there was good network in Samsung mobile, no network in redmi & lenovo A6000.This is the build quality of Chinese mobile.***",

But from next month it was starting problem with recharge and sound. After all due slow recharge and low backup it was recharged by maximum time as a result charger also get damaged and its battery also not functioning and start soling the body. Similarly Sound system also totally breakdown. Due to failure of  sound system i got very difficulties. I logged the complain in my nearest service centre at Sai Nigam Tech Services, Bhubaneswar on dtd.23.10.2017. So, the total set was absolutely fault in manufacturing.

It connects wifi within short distance and disconnects if there are number of users on wifi.This phone is nice after all, have multiple users so multiple whatsapp users can used on it without any problem.

  "cust_review": "Got Huawei P30 Pro aurora 8GB/256GB yesterday with GT sport watch.The phone- It is beyond camera.Zoom ultimate, as good as you got hold of moon. Super night photography the sky comes on ground with normal stable hand stars gets captured in your phone. Performance unmatched, speed excellent super fast, battery powerful. In totality this is the world's best and top most mobile ever launched and used. 100 out of 100. Rest you need to try on your own for sure!***Awesome phone. Stellar battery life. Excellent low light photography.Only major con for me was emui.***Best camera phone in the market. Low light photography is magic. So is zoom on a phone.Design of the phone is top notch.Feels and looks like a flagship.Battery is amazing. Lasts two days on normal usage.Cons: edge display makes accidental touches. EMUI is not as good as stock Android.***User experience is worst , i hate the emui os , heating problem trash phone\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e***Product arrived as promised one next to next day of ordering.On opening the box, seriously I was stunned.It took some time to get knack of it. But once I used it, I loved the emui.Design is superb,Display is awesome,Feel is premiumIt's not slippery, though use the case provided.Battery backup is great.Camera is all rounder. Sample shots attachedCharging is crazy fast.No lag issues.And the more you use it, more you gonna love it.***I've been debating over buying a phone for quite a while. I saw that this phone was not due to be released till the 15th. I couldn't wait, I had ordered it from aliexpress. There were delays in shipping them out so I ordered one from Amazon. I personally don't like Samsung phones. I've been using pixels since they were launched and I was amazed by the low light shots it could take. The huawei phones pretty much flew under the radar and didn't seem much of an upgrade.This phone changed everything.The camera is good, low light shots are incredibly detailed. I can see the freakin moon with the craters (almost) without my telescope (celestron astromaster 130eq Md). The ai scene identification is accurate. Videos are average though.  The camera has tons of modes and a very customizable manual mode.The UI needs a little getting used to from a stock android user perspective.  The voice call quality for both the acoustic display and the microphone are very good.Gaming is a blast, I could game for 3hours of Pubg before the phone needing a recharge. The 4200mah battery and the supercharger make life so much better.The display is fhd plus. You should have no issues playing 4k videos downloaded from anywhere.You can connect the phone to the TV using a USB 3.1 to hdmi adapter and use it as a chromebook. Wireless also works but there is a little bit of latency, which is to be expected. You can also game this way.Overall I'm very very satisfied with the purchase. Its and blind buy. Multi tasking is a breeze.To get most of the battery, use a dark theme and a black wallpaper as this is an AMOLED display.***Fhd display is a big letdown not flagship standard....low light capabilities with night mode on is excellent as well as zoom other than that nothing,images are terribly over sharpened and video recording is awful with frequent frame drops and stutters ....emui is terrible,poor display***Phone is awesome. Excellent camera and stunning low light photography. Battery life is very good.Only thing which is not good is that huawei does not release software updates here in India on time. Huawei doesn't give importance to this region.***",

  "cust_review": "First impressions - nice, handy, good performance and features for all basic needs. Overall great value for money - especially after price drop.I just wanted a quality, small sized smart phone, that can serve my basic needs and within a small budget. Moto E4 ticked all my preferences.Surprisingly - got a \"Made in India\" February-2018 make phone!!!The phone comes with some India specific apps pre-installed - like phone pe etc. But unlike the Motorolla/Google apps, these can be uninstalled if you don't want them.***The phone has a poor battery life. Generally, the battery doesn't last for a day even if you're not using it. Besides, there are some voice issues too.The handset that I have bought from Amazon appears to be faulty. Despite a visit to the service centre, the problems remain unresolved. Quite a pathetic phone. Won't recommend to anyone.***Phone quality is gud. But its battry is too week. Not works for a single day.***Moto is one of my favorites among many smartphone brands. Bought this for my father (who was using a basic Nokia fone before). 2600mah of battery would be gud enuf to make and take calls, I thought. But, was disappointed, to see how the battery drains in no time. Heats up easily. I wonder if this happens with all Moto phones. Picture quality and colour saturation seems top notch. Sound is OK. Camera is a heartbreak.***i want give the 5 stars to amazon. when i recived the moto e4 mobile it is no working but amazon techincians and must call operators to give such good information to me. i talkd to two people about this problem they give super response but am not able to give the feedback at the time and am give mistakenly bad feedback. am really very sory for the call operators. ur work is just ossam***I open the box and insert my both sim cardsAnd both are not working.......Showing invalid........Just can't believe.....Don't know to whom I can blame for the same, to Motorola or Amazon***Very nice, having smart finger sensing***The hardware did not start once we got the delivery. Later on, we got the replacement of the phone. That replaced phone also stopped working within few months (but within warranty period) and there is no warranty claim option provided by Amazon. At Motorola service center, they were asking for documents which we didn't receive on delivery and hence the phone is of no use now.***",

  "cust_review": "I will suggest all who are buying this in the name of Smart Android Tv. This is totally pathetic product and you will regret it and when you try to return it Amazon customer care will make a number of excuses and keep your phone on waiting for more than 30 minutes by just transferring call here and there to a different department. Let me tell you why.1) They say ultra-bright display. You will see your own face while paying youtube video on this tv. what kind of ultra-bright display it is?2) They say built-in chromecast . A built-in chromecast which does not support any Netflix, Amazon. Tell me what kind of chromecast is on this tv?3) They mentioned on the HDMI port as HDMI ARC. When I try to connect tv with my home theater it not delivering any sound to home theater. I try it by playing youtube on TV.4) While writing this review. I am on call with Amazon. It has been 32 minutes and Amazon customer care is transferring my call to next and next department and nobody assures me that they will return the product or refund me.I will upload a video of how the display quality it.  Please do not purchase in the name of Android instead purchase a normal tv with IPS display.***The picture quality is not good. Resolution is poor with HD connection of my DTH connected through an HDMI cable  even though it's an HD ready TV. I didn't find any difference in picture quality with HDMI and RCA inputs. Greenish hue with pixelated appearance of the image was seen even in close view, perhaps defective. Sound quality is okay in low volume but clarity is lost and crackles with medium to high volume.  The built is flimsy. But I admire Amazon for it's customer care services for smooth return and refund of the product for which I would give five stars.***I bought this TV, As it is an android TV it should have Amazon Prime & Netflix. But both applications are restricted in playstore by MI - So I told them to place a return request but they are not accepting it. Saying you should have to confirm it before placing an order. So now on If i will have to buy any android mobile, I will have to call them and confirm all the thousands of applications which is available in playstore - asking whether this applications are supported in mobile or not. Screen quality is too poor. I am prime member of Amazon - But I am saying now never buy anything from Amazon - Cancelling my subscription of Amazon prime as well***Installation takes ages.Still not installed 7 days have passed.***Bad product marinated in marketing flavor.its totally mi's misleading add. Picture and sound quality pathetic, in same range Micromax canvas 3 display and sound is way better than this. Those who are thinking to purchase it is no where near to reputed brand.Amazon delivery and installation was good and on time as promised.***I bought it in October. Got delivered fast, on October 13 i got this tv ans has been using it ever since. Today on January 4th, the Android suddenly crashes and displays this message. There is an option to factory reset but nothing is happening. Now have to give this to some customer care centre to get it fixed. When it works, it is real good. WHEN IT WORKS.Update: I contacted Mi customer care yesterday and they were able to resolve the issue in no time. I was concerned that i had to take it to the service centres or send to back to Mi like we do for mobile replacement.To my surprise i was told that THERE ARE NO SERVICE CENTRES CURRENTLY FOR Mi TV's. No service network at all. The customer care executive told me If the issue exists even after the fix is tried, i had to register for an installation request and then have the technician coming in for TV installation take a look at the TV to fix the issue. Other than that, I don't think Mi has any service options for their customers.***Pros:1. Very Good Picture quality with nice sound system.2. A nice TV with Android & Chromecast facility in Low Cost.3. Wifi functionality is perfect.4. Google voice search works fine.5. Chormecast working fine.Cons:1. Amazon Prime Video & Netflix could not be found pre-loaded and could not be installed via play store.2. I can't find any pre-loaded browser by default.3. With some efforts using computer we can install some apps like (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix & Chrome)4. We could not choose default TV Input(AV Mode) when we put on TV. Because of this every time we have to choose input source for AV Mode.If these defects are rectified in future through updation, this tv would be the best low cost tv available in Indian Market.***I have been purchasing multiple products over Amazon since its advent, sometimes even amounting to 1 lakh. I haven't reviewed a single item ever in my life. This time I am forced to.A brief timeline:A) Since this product was an Android TV at a steal price, I bought it, until realizing a big gaffe I had made.B) I received the product on 28th October. I was told not to unbox it until MI support did so.C) Mi support unboxes and wall mounts the TV on 31st. To both of our surprise, the remote is not present in the box.D) As a guileless person who trusts values, I thought it of a minor mistake and raised a case with MI care. Even Mi installation guy raised a case internally.E) After numerous followups (spending almost 2+hours), I was apprised on 1st Nov that \"as per internal investigation was done by MI, the package delivered to me was intact\".F) I have been still following up with MI, and the TV is useless because it needs remote for the initial setup.In a nutshell, we all believe MI products are great. The phones definitely are but cannot say exactly about TVs. I understand we all tend to buy amazing products at great deals. Everyone should.But one needs to be careful of why still Samsung or Sony are finest. That is because they value their customers. It is all about ethics and principles. If MI cannot trust the integrity of its customers, thenneither am I bound to.***",

  "cust_review": "Hi all, I booked note 4 through amazon. After 20 days suddenly I faced battery issue so I took that mobile to redmi center. They told it is mother board issue and it can't repair on warrenty.it is fault on online shipping. So I contacted Amazon care center. They it is fault with redmi. But finally I lossed 11,000 in between them.This is they are giving responsibility to costmers ....***Hi All,After using 6 months I am writing this review of the product.First of all, as every online buyer, I also searched a lot to get the best phone at the budget price and finally decided to take this one.Similar product purchased by my family members I had taken their experience also before buying this.In my family 5 members using the same produt and no one any problem since 1-year use.So I confirmed to take this one.If you planning to buy the best budget phone up to 10000Rs then definitely go for this.So many good things about this phone, you can find other reviews also. But here I want to make Some points to be cleared.As I am a heavy user of the internet I had tested with 100% battery in the morning and even after whole day browsing using lots of Application I have found At the end of the day battery still with 15% backup. I have noticed an Android application hang problem when you are using 4-5 Apps running simultaneously for long use. Also found Battery Heating problems while full charging temp reaches to 41 degrees measured with android battery apps.So Finally consider all things and go for it if you are interested....***Pathetic service from Mi service centre and the quality of product is bad. Its motherboard stopped functioning in 4-5 months after purchase the mi service centre replaced its motherboard but phone then stopped receiving signals and MI service centre is not admitting their fault.******Excellent product....battery lasts for 2 days minimum.... superb speaker volume ... speakers at the base... buy the rugged case cover from amazon... everything is awesome... Camera is OK not great..... all in all, one of the best phones... MUCH MUCH better than the known brands like samsung , LG, Nokia...... Maker is Chinese, but phone made in Andhra pradesh , India***Redmi Note 4 remains a very popular obile phone and was the most popular in 2017. However with the passage of time the front camera need update and the software becomes slow. The primary problem with such Chinese origin phones is their reluctance to  learn from Apple.The hardware remains an issue and these phones are primarily targetting the Lower Middle Class segment who constitute the bulk of  Mobile set consumers in India at present. Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi  must  develop in this aspect.***The manufacturers say that Amazon is not authorized to sell their product. Hence can not take any responsibility. I was not able to communicate with the phone as I was not able to hear any thing from the called party.The SIP tray was  not very flimsy. I was able to return because it was sold by AMAZON ,courtesy it's  global service quality. I went for MOTO as we had purchased 5 earlier mobiles.***It is good but it was not rebooting again and again without starting android suddenly before a week. Charge was also there. Still i put it on charge, and it became fine after some time. Now i don't put it off at all as i am scared this may happen again. Is there a solution for this.***",

The problem with this Colors is that the alphabets are written in grey colour on the keypad and when you type the LCD light glows and you cannot see the letters properly. So if you have good hold on keypad then only buy white gold colour.i bought it for my mom's but she is finding it difficult to type. The camera doest work without memory card. So you will have to buy a memory card as well. There is no option of changing the ringtone.In short. It is a basic phone to be used for only calling and messages***Good quality basic phone with good battery backup. Premium look and camera quality is decent  in this price range. For who did not know how to use smart phone this is the best phone them.Positive things:1. Build quality2. Battery backup3. Premium look4. Decent camera5. Good priceAdditional benefit: 2 year warranty.***Nalla tha irruku enna Bluetooth la External \ud83d\udd0aspeaker la connect panna mudiyula \ud83d\udd07 but my car stereo player la connect aaguthu.***Sound quality is good, battery quality should be more better......***This handset is amazing superb sound quality, handset looks very pretty, value for money, I am using this phone last 1month and it is very nice***The description provided for this phone was that it has 1)  screen shot - available but hidden _you have to tap & hold the call key to capture screenshot , 2) camera is very poor,3) internet - not available. 4) only 3 languages are available not so many as featured, spark i7 is better than i8 in respect of value.***After 1 month of usage , the phone started hanging, we cannot hear what the other person says .

  "cust_review": "I bought Samsung s9 plus 64gb N 29 TH OCT from seller APPARIO RETAIL PRIVATE LTD.Cell was delivered  on time but after installing the sim when started the cell found out the bottom touch sensor srcreen( Back ,home and multitasking touch area ) not operational .How come new brand cell worth 64500 is defective .Had no quality checks been done prior delivery done by the seller ????Are these people selling defective handset ??????***I recently purchased the S9 Plus(Coral Blue) and it wasn't even in my wishlist before few days,I was willing to buy the One Plus 6T but felt disappointed with the overall device,so decided to go for S9 Plus and got it for 41K after all offers and exchangesDisplay : One of the best hands down,I have compared it with One Plus 6T and Iphone XS Max and it is better than both,plus those curves make the device look just so beautiful no complaints here.Built : Same as the S8 Plus,but still overall it looks like a really expensive device and yes it it,so justifies the price,has glass at the back so happy with the built, Coral Blue looks beautiful.Battery : This is the only area I am disappointed,just 3500 mah battery capacity and it drains pretty quickly on games like PUBG,Asphalt 9, and earlier I was using Dash Charge so I am addicted to those high speeds,but S9 Plus just supports QC 2.0 so charging feels really slow and it takes about just over 1 hr 40 mins to completely charge the phone from 0 to 100%,Samsung should have atleast included QC 3.0.Cameras : Lots and Lots of modes are provided to enhance the camera performance like portrait ,pro mode, selfie focus, food and many more,plus they have added AR Emoji that is replica of Animoji from Apple,but it is really bad,all people look like same character,they should improve it,the cameras have another feature,on taking any potrait shot on rear camera you can adjust the background blur even after taking the picture and you can also change the same picture to wide angle shot.Low light performance is great and the variable aperture acts as a useful feature,not just a gimmick,Super Slow Mo is cool to have but limited to just few seconds, video recording is Ok but colors little over saturated(I personally like it this way)Performance :  Indian variant comes with Xynos 9810 SOC and Mali Processor,as such Mali is not considered good for gaming but ,For gaming I have played PUBG and Asphalt 9 and both work super smooth,I play PUBG on HDR(Ultra) and yes it works fine, but the phone tends to heat after few minutes of game play, I guess it is normal for any phone to heat with those high graphic settings, and in case of applications it is quick to open almost all applications and haven't faced any lags till now.UI/Software : Yes it is not as stock or Oxygen but still after using Oxygen OS before, I am even happy using Samsung Experience 9.0, it has few flaunting features like the Edge Lighting,Dolby Atmos Audio,great gestures,and much moreAudio : Having stereo speakers,it is on  of the best sound I have heard on any Smartphone,and the sound output through the headphone jack is amazing and on enabling Dolby Atmos you'll really find a good difference in sound(I use it with Poweramp and Amazon Music).Security : You can unlock your phone in 4 ways :Iris : Slow but accurateFace : Really FastFingerprint at the back : Again it's super fastFace+Iris : Slow but really secureAndroid Updates : When I got the phone it was on October Security Patch Update so means Samsung is providing updates,but still no sign of Android Pie,maybe it'll come near by the launch of Galaxy S10.Overall : I got this phone at 41K and I am really happy with overall device,leaving aside the battery everything is premium and that display alone is a reason to show off with the edge lighting on for Notifications,Camera's are excellent,Audio is amazing and Samsung UI has tons of small features that any one would love to have.Note : I gave the device 5 stars earlier but After using it for 20 days I have got scratches on the display,I don't know how,gorilla glass 5 on device really looks fragile,using it with proper flip cover and all,now Samsung and Amazon are not helping and putting the blame on one another,so I am disappointed with my purchase :(***Display is best available in this planet right now. Camera may be too. Dolby Atmos works like a charm. Headphones are of top notch. Go for it if you have an iphone budget for an android.Amazon Transportation Services i guess is the worst in this planet. . First when i called he mentioned that my office is closed due to Saturday. But u fortunately he forgot that it\u2019s a bank and it remains open. He was caught in his play. Then The delivery guy postponed my delivery only because he needs to take a U turn on the highway to reach my office. Then he stopped picking my calls. Then one of my femal colleague called and he came for delivery. Sad state of affairs at Amazon Transportation Services. Also the delivery agent number couldn\u2019t be reached because they are equipped with JIO phones. That adds to the agony.During last order too the delivery guy canceled my order saying my address isn\u2019t traceable. Sadly my address itself is a landmark in that area. I escalated to Amazon and they did it again.If possible avoid Amazon. They create depression instead of happiness.***Don't buy this phone if you don't want yourself stuck with charger ND phone permanently. Doesn't matter how much apps you have in your phone, battery will drain rapidly. Just google \"s9+ battery problem\" and save yourself from the hassles of life. And low light is pathetic in front camera,***",

  "cust_review": "The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering \"mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money\". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime. In then situation, when there was good network in Samsung mobile, no network in redmi & lenovo A6000.This is the build quality of Chinese mobile.***",

I contacted the customer care about the 2 GB missing, but no much response from their end.But, it does support SD card and so I have enough space for my use.The Eye Comfort mode is also good as it changes the color to warm which is good to eyes at night.Preloaded MS Office is also good.Overall it is a good tab to use with a good response and oh yes, it does have a Kids mode with drawing feature. The kids mode can be exited only by entering a password which is good.At times it shows a bit lagging, but on clearing the open apps it quickly returns to normal.Also individual apps can be locked with password.***8inch 4G Tablet is really made by aluminium alloy body it's comes with 1.4ghz processor and 4800 mah batteryIps display is stunning with eyecare modeAndroid 7.0 with EMUI 5.1Sound and camera are also goodOverall performance is best in this price range***Cheated with the item...

I did not put a sim and so with regular use I am able to use this for two days in one single charge, by putting auto sleep from 11 pm to 6 am.One problem that I can point out is that the 16 GB version that I bought is already having ~6GB used up by the OS and the rest of the free space and app was coming only to ~8 GB. I contacted the customer care about the 2 GB missing, but no much response from their end.But, it does support SD card and so I have enough space for my use.The Eye Comfort mode is also good as it changes the color to warm which is good to eyes at night.Preloaded MS Office is also good.Overall it is a good tab to use with a good response and oh yes, it does have a Kids mode with drawing feature. The kids mode can be exited only by entering a password which is good.At times it shows a bit lagging, but on clearing the open apps it quickly returns to normal.Also individual apps can be locked with password.***8inch 4G Tablet is really made by aluminium alloy body it's comes with 1.4ghz processor and 4800 mah batteryIps display is stunning with eyecare modeAndroid 7.0 with EMUI 5.1Sound and camera are also goodOverall performance is best in this price range***Cheated with the item...

  "cust_review": "The G6 is LG's nicest-looking flagship yet, which I don't say often, especially given last year's out-there G5. But the polished G6 has a streamlined aesthetic and a smooth unibody design (think the LG V20 with fewer seams or the G5 with fewer bumps). It's a bit heavy in the hand, but that doesn't bother me much. Like with previous LG handsets, the fingerprint sensor is built into the home button on the back, which sits below the camera (and not next to it, like with the S8). Oh, and don't worry, there's still a headphone jack.The sharp, 5.7-inch screen takes up roughly 80 percent of the front of the phone, leaving it with an impressively thin bezel all around. It's unique in that it has an 18:9 aspect ratio (with the exception of the S8, most phones are 16:9).The phone feels expansive and \"tall,\" especially when you're scrolling down your web browser or social media feed. Not all apps and games take full advantage of this ratio though, and when they can't, you'll see black bars on the sides of the display even at full screen, aka \"pillarboxing.\" You can enable \"app scaling\" on some apps by going into Settings. The longer display works, and seeing that you get more screen for about the same build size,In addition to its beautifully glossy design and screen, the G6 is dust- and water-resistant like the S8s, the Apple iPhone 7s and several Sony Xperia phones. It's rated IP68, so you can dunk it in up to 4.9 feet of water (about 1.5 meters) for up to 30 minutes. For the everyday user though, it just means the G6 won't crap out after you accidentally drop it in the pool or spill coffee on it. (Get a deeper dive on IP ratings and what they mean for waterproof gadgets.) I dunked it in a fishbowl and a bucket of water and let it sit each time underwater for 30 minutes. I also placed it inside a shower with the water splashing on it for 30 minutes. In all three instances, the handset kept ticking fine afterward, and it even registered an incoming call during the full dunking.Non-removable battery is a bummerWith that said, waterproofing and removable batteries don't tend to go together these days, so the fact that the G6 does not have a removable battery was kind of a given. Still, to longtime LG fans, this might come as a disappointment. After the LG G2 in 2013, the company has been one of the few holdouts to feature swappable batteries in its flagship phones, so people can switch a drained one for a charged one or replace an old battery with a fresh one.ReviewPricesSpecsLG ForumNot having that advantage is a drag, but it's not a deal-breaker for everyone either. LG also hopes that the G6's increased battery capacity (from 2,800mAh in the G5 to 3,300mAh) and new wireless charging feature -- just for the US -- can offset the benefits of a swappable battery. During our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the handset lasted an average of 13 hours and 21 minutes, which is better than last year's 12.5 hours.Go wide or square with the camerasLike the V20  and the G5 before it, the G6 has two cameras on the back. But they aren't to take artsy \"bokeh\" portraits like you do with the iPhone 7 Plus. On the G6, you can switch between the standard 13-megapixel lens and the 120-degree wide-angle lens to capture more content in each frame. If you're really all about that wide-angle life, the 5-megapixel front-facing shooter has a wide-angle option as well.One of my favorite things about the camera is a new interface that shows you five of your most recent photos, like a gallery stream. LG added a separate camera app called Square Camera too. Aimed at hardcore Instagram users, it offers a number of different tools to take neat square photos. (For more on how Square Camera works, watch the video below and check out our explainer.)Life's just fine with Snapdragon 821The G6 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processing platform, which specs nerds will notice is the same chipset in last year's OnePlus 3T and Google Pixels. Compared to the 821 chipset, Qualcomm's latest 835 is measurably smaller, faster and quicker at recharging mobile batteries.When I benchmarked the 835 in a reference device, it indeed outpaced phones with the 821 (including the G6) by a comfortable margin. And while the S8, which also has the 835 for certain markets, garnered slightly lower scores than the reference device (this makes sense, since reference devices are designed for peak performance), the S8 still consistently edged out the G6.But take these results with a pinch of salt. Unless you want to be on the absolute edge of technology, the idea of being saddled with \"last year's\" processor shouldn't be a huge deal, and the advantages of the 835 aren't that dramatic on paper. In the real world, the usual differences between one superfast processor and another are hardly discernible. During my time with the G6, it was smooth and fast. Apps launched and quit promptly, the camera operated quickly and the display was responsive.If you're considering:LG G6 vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: I don't mind that the G6 has an \"older\" processor, but the S8 has a longer battery life, and other than that annoying fingerprint reader placement, the S8 looks better in general. If you need the best-of-the-best and have the money, get the S8. But the G6 is a solid alternative that can come cheaper.LG G6 vs. Google Pixel XL: The Pixel XL has a better camera (especially when handling low light), while having the same 821 chipset. But it's more expensive, not waterproof, doesn't have expandable storage and and people have pointed out that it looks like an iPhone doppelganger. If you don't care about any of that and you'd rather capture better photos, get the XL. (Just also keep in mind that its sequel is due in a few months.)LG G6 vs. OnePlus 3T: the 3T goes big on value while having powerful enough hardware to hang with the big leagues (case in point: both handsets have the 821). However, the 3T isn't water-resistant, the camera doesn't have nearly as many features as the G6, and it too came out last year. So if you can spring for the G6, go for it. But if saving a notable amount of dough is reason enough for you, the 3T won't let you down.If you liked this review please vote it as helpful.Thanks***PROSBeautifully crafted with sharp, bright and crystal clear screen.The best ever set of cameras I could ever find in a phone at Rs 28k.Camera is potential enough of clicking distortion free long exposure shots upto 30 secs.Only phone that provides full manual control on clicking pictures and recording videos.Wide angle camera with fixed focus is just a cherry on a cake. It helps in clicking landscapes, indoor photos without worrying about the focus.Transition between both the camera is amazing. One can switch from standard to wide angle camera even while recording a video.Slow motion, time lapse with inbuilt software to set the play speed after shooting.There is too much to explore in the camera section.Oreo update is also available. After that auto camera mode is gone lot better.UI is also good and simple, not too complicated with too much customization.USB type C fast charger charges the phone from 10%-50%  in just 30 mins.Good quality earphone is also provided in the box.Ice Platinum color is awesome and doesn't reflect finger print like black.CONSBattery life is not very good. It could hardly cross a day with normal usage.Not suggested for selfie lovers, just 5 mp front camera.Auto mode is just half of as good a Manual mode in case of picture clarity, sharpness, lightning.Led notification light is missing and replaced with always on screen notification.***Phone is damn tooo good and for the first time switched from samsung to LG for flagship phones and this phone fullfilled my expectations and  build quality is super.***This phone is good in it's own ways...Camera: OIS is the best feature and wide angle camera complements the camera setup!Amazing pics can be taken from this phone.Video recording is smooth and crisp, it allows microphone control as well!It is really content creator's phone.Though front camera is not so good...Build: sturdy and superb! Feels really good in handsSound: speaker is comfortably loud and with wired headphones it sound much betterScreen: Amazing display!! Though it is LCD still looks very vivid and rich!Games: played games like pubg, gods of rome and didn't feel lag. For pubg initially felt lag but with higher frame rate and balanced graphics it runs smooth!Battery: screen on time is around 4 to 5 hours! For me it lasts one day easily! As it has fast charging, in 30mins it charges around 40% which is very useful!It is a good phone if you don't bother very much about selfies! Looks are also gret!***Bought on exchange with LG G3. I was hooked to \"LG style\" last few years so much, that I began eyeing their top model V30+ . But the latter was unjustifiably expensive for me and I ended up ordering G6.Review after 2 months of use:For my lifestyle sound (during workouts) and camera (images for quick reports) functions are important. While camera is WAY better than in the previous model, I had a slight problem with sound. The day I paired the phone with car's  bluetooth  -  sound in earphones had disappeared. I was thinking taking it to the service centre, but last moment had decided to get an answer from the net forums. Indeed this model have various problems with sound. With the help of a thick needle I somehow fixed the earphone jack and got the sound back in earphones. Since then I've never faced any problems.Sound quality as well as new designed earphones are great;Camera has new features as instant touch ups. Quality of closed up shots have surprised me even more;DUAL SIM works flawless !!! WOW!!!***Excellent device with great performance and battery life. Camera is pretty special , with the price point at which it is selling this is an excellent buy.***",

The build quality and performance is top notch. It feels so good and reassuring to hold in the hand. The camera quality is really good(Using Google Camera). Overall very happy with the phone I highly recommend it.***Phone gets hanged while camera on***I've always been a Nokia fan and was waiting for a new launch after the Lumia series.This was a fair enough launch I must say. I expected more, yes.The look and feel of the phone is incredible. Curved edges, metallic back with that copper lining, I must say the work done on the body is absolutely amazing. The problem with curved edges (as with any model) will be that the screen guard won't sit properly, so maybe Nokia could provide us with a screen guard.The box came with headphones which is a blessing, many companies don't do that any more.The usb-c charger is awesome. You just have to carry it on you. With a micro USB, you can assume someone or the other would have it. Maybe this too would pick up, let's see.The camera is really good. Sharp images and kind of makes you feel like a pro. But with such competition in the market, the customer can always demand for more.Now coming to the software, this is where one can't give that extra star. I wished it was more user friendly and that my apps stopped stalling. It's been just over a month and already I have stalling apps. This is not acceptable.Display is good. Great resolution, extra small font option (the way I like it), very nice back light, usually minimum is too bright for me, but in this phone, it's perfect!I can go on and on, but I want to end here. Thanks!***Looks exactly as in the pictures. Wish it was as strong as a Nokia of the old ;). Good display. Sufficiently fast. Sufficient storage.Battery could be better though. The screen really milks the battery at full brightness. Phone needs to be charged after about 8 hours of medium to heavy use. A Redmi note 5 does much better on this count.Good camera and selfie cam too. Overall a good purchase.***Nokia has been known for its premium build quality. With that expectation I considered the Nokia 6.1. This phone absolutely matches that level of expectation. With Android One, the concern about updated software is also taken care of.The camera is decent. The weight is good. There is a fast charger. This phone ticks all the boxes.It definitely feels solid in the hand. A premium phone at a mid range cost.***Battery life quite good.Already updated to Android Pie.Camera quality more than goodwith functionality of PIP and so.Pretty vibrant display.Hardly any lag / freeze even while multiple apps are running.Hybrid Dual SIM and microSD actually means : SIM + SIM/microSD cardComes with android one so no annoying preloaded bundled appsCorning Gorilla Glass screen of this phone made me rethink what Gorilla Glass possibly actually is, in better way obviously.Fast charging with USB-C type connection port.Sound quality ok but expect way better from likes of NOKIA, even for such a budget phone.Fingerprint sensor at the rear side below the rear camera lens.***",

Earlier got the j tab which is a similar model and dual SIM but no volte. This is cheaper but single SIM and 5mp camera instead of 8mp. Both feel the same and 5mp camera is just fine. So if dual SIM not important then get this and volte without an app... battery lasts an entire day due to slow a57 quad core CPU which is enough to do most things.

This is not my first apple product but it's my first iPad. I'm really satisfied. So don't be worried regarding the authenticity. It's 100% authentic.I won't be writing anything about the iPad cause you can always check that out on YouTube or Google. And it's exactly as reviewed by others.If you find my review satisfactory, do give a like\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude03***Bought at 22000.For first time iOS users it is a little pain to understand iOS as it is not totally open os.

You can also side load apps (without jailbreak) from some sites but then you have to give trust permission to some Chinese information company which I am not very confident about,so it\u2019s better to stick with App Store.At first the most disappointing and shocking thing for android user is that there is no file manager app like android.There is file manager app but there usage is limited. You can\u2019t open any file or folder and cut,copy ,paste any file.To copy , paste any file is quite complicated thing and one have to take some time to understand it.The picture quality is awesome for the price.The 2gb ram is more than sufficient as it is equal to 4gb of android if not 6gb.The reason is that iOS is totally optimised for it and there is not bloatware.The camera is good not the best but you will like the live feature of the camera .You can take some beautiful pictures from it if light is sufficient.Last it is best for reading(not like kindle),watching movies as battery backup is great, and playing games.It is not best for making a presentation, or doing something which essentially requires a laptop,so it is not a replacement of laptop.You may find many times you have to go to your laptop or desktop for some works which you will feel is very difficult if not impossible todo in iPad due to its restricted os***Purchased this ipad 2018(6th generation) in sale for Rs 19,999/- on oct-13-2018  the aggressive pricing of this ipad made this as a best product in this price range. Thanks for the seller ( Appario retail private Ltd ) for sending me a genuine product and it works pretty fine.Gold color on this ipad looks pretty decent because of its coppery gold finish as shown in the picture above.Pros:*Improved graphics while playing graphic intensive games like PUBG and fortnight.*Bigger display.*Bigger battery  8760 mah.*apple pencil support.Cons:*Not a laminated display.*No anti reflecting screen.*First generation fingerprint scanner.*No stereo speakers.it's a budget ipad but specs are decent enough for its price. i bought this ipad for playing Pubg and im totally satisfied with its performance because i can play pubg at HDR settings coz of its A10 fusion chipset. same chipset we can see in iphone 7 plus.its a beast when coming to its battery life. upto 10 hrs of battery backup with one full charge.with 100% charge i played PUBG for three hours it used only 55% and the battery is still at 45% ( with 9.7\" screen u can play PUBG like never before). After that i watched some youtube videos and it still got some juice in it.cameras are good but not the best.it is much better than its predecessor i.e., ipad 5th gen because of its higher performance with apple A10 fusion chip.You cant do all the editing and heavy multitasking like a ipad pro model but at this price point it's a better value than ever.***Noticed a small dot inside the screen on the same day. I asked amazon customer to return or replace the item. And some lagging issues found. Please return or replace the product with proper product.***I have been an Android user and this is my first Apple product, so naturally I was a bit skeptical about the restrictions in iOS. But this iPad made me fall in love with it. The simplicity and smoothness of iOS is addictive. Yes, the \"do anything\" versatility of Android products is sorely missed but the clean user interface, brilliant retina display, terrific built quality and precision of the touch input makes up for these. Camera quality is not as good as today's smartphones, but using an iPad to take photos is anyway a foolish idea if you have a good smartphone and a DSLR. Loved GarageBand and Measure apps in iOS 12. It comes with an inbuilt Barometer, so you can measure the atmospheric pressure and hence the altitude... Helpful if you love exploring places. Sound quality is quite good for its size. The iPad feels quite light without a cover but it is advisable to purchase a cover separately.***Apple ipad is the best option if you want to buy any tablet, don't think much just go for it. It is really wonderful and you will love it. Functions and features are very good. Runs smoothly never lags or hangs...not a little even. You can do everything in it without a laptop. And as it is an apple product, its amazing. And this one is at cheapest price. I got it at just Rs. 20000/- in Great Indian Sale. Thanks to amazon. I had ordered the golden one but its actually Rose gold looks better than the previous 2017 version also it supports apple pencil. The colour is such that you will just love it. I couldn't stop myself giving it 5 stars. Go for it.***I just bought it yesterday. Everything works fine. The iPad came with all the accessories that apple provides. It pairs perfectly with my iPhone 8plus. I plan to use it as a study tool. If you are an average user who needs an ipad for browsing, watching Videos, making digital notes then this is the best and the smartest option .***Apple products are always amazing. Got this during the great India sale for 22k. Definitely worth the money.Display is great and smooth.I think 9.7 is the perfect size for a tablet. It perfectly fits in ur handbag. The camera isn't all that bad for the price.***",

  "cust_review": "Hi all, I booked note 4 through amazon. After 20 days suddenly I faced battery issue so I took that mobile to redmi center. They told it is mother board issue and it can't repair on warrenty.it is fault on online shipping. So I contacted Amazon care center. They it is fault with redmi. But finally I lossed 11,000 in between them.This is they are giving responsibility to costmers ....***Hi All,After using 6 months I am writing this review of the product.First of all, as every online buyer, I also searched a lot to get the best phone at the budget price and finally decided to take this one.Similar product purchased by my family members I had taken their experience also before buying this.In my family 5 members using the same produt and no one any problem since 1-year use.So I confirmed to take this one.If you planning to buy the best budget phone up to 10000Rs then definitely go for this.So many good things about this phone, you can find other reviews also. But here I want to make Some points to be cleared.As I am a heavy user of the internet I had tested with 100% battery in the morning and even after whole day browsing using lots of Application I have found At the end of the day battery still with 15% backup. I have noticed an Android application hang problem when you are using 4-5 Apps running simultaneously for long use. Also found Battery Heating problems while full charging temp reaches to 41 degrees measured with android battery apps.So Finally consider all things and go for it if you are interested....***Pathetic service from Mi service centre and the quality of product is bad. Its motherboard stopped functioning in 4-5 months after purchase the mi service centre replaced its motherboard but phone then stopped receiving signals and MI service centre is not admitting their fault.******Excellent product....battery lasts for 2 days minimum.... superb speaker volume ... speakers at the base... buy the rugged case cover from amazon... everything is awesome... Camera is OK not great..... all in all, one of the best phones... MUCH MUCH better than the known brands like samsung , LG, Nokia...... Maker is Chinese, but phone made in Andhra pradesh , India***Redmi Note 4 remains a very popular obile phone and was the most popular in 2017. However with the passage of time the front camera need update and the software becomes slow. The primary problem with such Chinese origin phones is their reluctance to  learn from Apple.The hardware remains an issue and these phones are primarily targetting the Lower Middle Class segment who constitute the bulk of  Mobile set consumers in India at present. Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi  must  develop in this aspect.***The manufacturers say that Amazon is not authorized to sell their product. Hence can not take any responsibility. I was not able to communicate with the phone as I was not able to hear any thing from the called party.The SIP tray was  not very flimsy. I was able to return because it was sold by AMAZON ,courtesy it's  global service quality. I went for MOTO as we had purchased 5 earlier mobiles.***It is good but it was not rebooting again and again without starting android suddenly before a week. Charge was also there. Still i put it on charge, and it became fine after some time. Now i don't put it off at all as i am scared this may happen again. Is there a solution for this.***",

  "cust_review": "The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.***I got the product today .. i activated it and installed the samsung shop app as described in the terms and condition but It says offer not eligible for you .***Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.***1st day mobile is dead and service centre reopen phone but hang problem and slow processing also faced***This is my first phone from samsung after apple x and this phone is great as compared to display quality and camera quality ..also has fast fingerprint BUT face recogintion is bit slower than iphone xI recommend to all to purchase as its worth for single penny***The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds.***S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.***Just bought it today at 9pm of 9th March from my friends mobile shop ...but after using it for 1 hour phone is stopped working it's not turning on not even charging I tried to reboot it how's my friend is telling me but it's not even showing me any single point on screen...it was my first Samsung phone but worked only for 1 hour worst experience ever ...***",

  "cust_review": "Amzon delivery is perfect. But display resolution is very bad . I opted it for browsing and reading pdf which is very basic need of tablet but belive me man if u r using 10 k phone nowadays then ur eye will never accept this tab resolution especially for text display. Build quality and other thing is very good but what if basic need is not fulfilled. First i opted lenovo tab 4 8plus and cancelled it beacuse of other issues reviewed in amazon. I think i was wrong.If any one need tablet for browsing and reading pdf then go for ipad 6th gen or higher resolution samsung  and other brand like lenovo tab .Samsung should learn from apple that they never launch tablet where basic requirement of tablet not fulfill . Which is display resolution. I m not satisfied even i got it for 8500 in sale.***Best Quality Tablet. Touch, Speed, Performance, are Smooth & Good...***Got it for about 9500 on the Great Indian Sale '18 and I thought it was one of the best deals ever!Display is pretty bright and love watching HD videos on here but cannot compare the display to a phone's as the PPI is obviously lower due to the screen size and for the price, it's pretty decent and love the blue light filter.The speaker is pretty clear and loud.It lags a bit sometimes while multitasking and memory management is kinda mess as it comes with just 2GB.It tends to stutter sometimes probably cuz IT HAS SNAPDRAGON 425, NOT 435 as the description says (it's what's given on FK as well) and hope the seller changes it for good.All in all, it's a decent tablet for the price after discount but you may probably need to consider other options if you aren't getting a nice deal. Feel 18k is a bit steep but you won't mind it if you have other Samsung devices like I do cuz of all their own environment like Smart Switch and Screen mirroring etc.Big THANKS TO AMAZON!!!***Picture quality is not so good. Bought it for my kids as they were using my iPad pro for watching YouTube videos. For 18k, this is not a gud buy. After reading the reviews I went for it. But was disappointed.. Price should be  12-14k.***Excellent tablet. Very nice product. Very friendly user interface. Large memory. Smooth usage. Fast processor. Overall a very reliable tablet.***I got this for Rs 6300/- with exchange and credit card discount during October offer period... too good in this price range... I m delighted.Using this since last 4 days now... works fine.This was not even the old stock... mfg date was September 2018....***Its been excellent.***Very good product. Size and appearance are as described. I purchased it in Amazon's exchange offer. It has excellent display, very good speed and other advanced features. It's very light and easy to use. It does not get heated up even it was left on throughtout the day. I purchased it for my daily activities and it's good.***",

  "cust_review": "I dont give 5star usually but these earbuds deserve it....Sound quality is amazingLooks premiumFits really wellPreviously i was using basshead225 but these are better in looks as well as performanceTotally recommended in this price range***Just one star for this product.i did not accept these type of product from realme. Realme says it has nice bass but I am unable to find a pure bass .it works like same that can you accept from a 100 rupees earphone easily can be purchased from local market.499 rupees is only from the product build and the megnetic impression.I think Sound quality can be much much much better after all we are paying 499.***Got this headphone yesterday and since then listening a lot of music through this earphone. Now I want to share my thoughts with you guys. When I first saw this product I loved it ,going by the advertisement and some of the reviews in YouTube I decided to purchase it but it seems to me that I have chosen wrong one. The main reason for why I bought this earphone was the bass and I tell you guys the bass is not satisfied, I mean it is not pathetic but those who are deep bass lovers would certainly be disappointed. I also have boAt 220 and bass output from this headset is slightly superior but those who do not love deep bass but love clear sound would be happy with this headset. One thing that would certainly make you happy is that the build quality. Use of magnet behind the ear plugs is very useful and a nice addition below rs 500 category.  Here follows my category wise rating1.Build quality- 9/102.Clarity- 8/103. Loudness- 8/104. Bass- 5/10(just because I am bass lover)I tested on two devices both are Dolby supported.I hope my review would be helpful to all.***Awesome product, just recieved in oneday delivery...Pros:1. Durable2. Good bass3. Good control like volume, track change, call reciece, cut.4.good vocal clearity5. Very loud, cant not listen in full volume6- very light waight.7- disign is very elegent, so fit perfectly.Cons: no as suchVerdict: One of the perfect earphone under pocket budget. If some is looking good value for money product, go for this blindly.***Ignore all negative reviews. If you have tight budget and you want decent earphones at \u20b9500 then just blindly go for it. This earphones won't disappoint you. Now come to review...Bass-4/5.Vocals-4.5/5Loudness-5/5 since they're very loud in just 50% volumeBuild-5/5 they provide kevlar cable in this price category which is unbelievable.If you're bass lover then just buy it without any hesitation.***The build quality is awesome ! But the sound quality is not good ! I'm not taking about bass ! But everything ... The treble sometimes dominates ..and a lot of sound output issues ! I've checked it with iPhone 6 .... Still same results ! ...I'm currently using in OnePlus 6 !! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e I'm returning this product !! Better to buy JBL cs 100si !***The product (real me buds) were deleivered on time. It was stated deleivery on 20th Jan but it came earlier on 17th Jan.Now lets start with its pros and consPros:-1) The quality of ear buds is amazing2) You will definately love the yellow colour at tips3) The sound quality is great at this price range4) The wire quality is really great as statedYou get Thickened wired at the bottom.5) The bass is good as compare in this budget.This is all the pros according to me now lets come to cons ::-1) The wire near the buds is slightly thin .2) Low sound instruments can't be heardThats all folks please make sure to hit the helpful button if it was one.***good earbud , but bass is not good ....if i say my truth am not satisfied.***",

  "cust_review": "Realme has made a name for itself by selling smartphones with powerful hardware at prices aggressive enough to go up against Xiaomi .Now, the company is looking at the lower end of the market by bringing in the successor to the Realme C1 (Review), aptly named the Realme C2. The Realme C2 starts at Rs. 5,999 .It's good in battery life , software,design and bad because it's performance is weak.Realme C2 has set new records as they have launched the best phone for just 6K.when Xiaomi was the only brand for beginners range but now Realme has come in the market to compete with them.Realme C2 is a complete and a great device for normal gamers but great entertainers and Realme C2 is a heavily configured phone with money-value.But there are some drawbacks so we talk about that1.The phone has a delicate plastic body which makes it a bit fragile and more prone to accidental damages. So you have to very cautious while handling it.2.The phone lacks a Fingerprint sensor .3.you cannot enjoy had videos in this smartphone.4.Cameras are average and do not perform as per expectations in low light and indoor lighting condition.Overall, the photos are respectable for a budget phone camera but don\u2019t expect much.If you\u2019re a clean and minimal stock android lover, then the plenty of features and apps might overwhelm you.the phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lone speaker grill at the bottom, power button to the right and volume rockers to the left alongside the SIM tray. The buttons are tactile, the headphone and speaker output are more than okay at this budget.The phone\u2019s decent display with fair color accuracy leaves us wishing it were a bit brighter tooThe Realme C2 is definitely a device you should go for as it delivers great performance and features. The most satisfying thing is its price that will wow your mind.We are gonna see how the Realme C2 holds up against the competition and why should you select it over other phones.***Camera is pathetic, no crisp only noises and blurry.Feel very dissapointed after purchased.***Amazing phone using since 1 month***The best thing about phone is it's  diamond cut design .It gives it classic look\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c***Best phone but the charging is too heavy we need to charge five hrfor completion of hundred percent charge***",

Face recognition is not so good.Storage - 64 GB is awesome.weight - Its a bit heavy phone as compared to other competitors.Battery - Fast charging - 70 min to fully charge and battery lasts for more than 24 hrs even with quite extensive internet usage.Price - Amazon sale gave a decent price and hence overall the phone is very good***Face unlock too slow,camera stabilisation is bad and lagging after 15days use over priced  phone***Great phone, but compared to A50, its not worthy. The price always stood at 29,995 so believed this was due to demand. Feature-wise, has all the features that's of use, NFC and paying from the phone directly without the need to carry a payment card everywhere is a very useful feature. Biometric unlook is not the fastest but still better that many other phones I've tried. If you're planning to buy, check A50 which much cheaper and has all the features of this phone***Good battery life and runs smoothly..using from last 6 month with no issue***Great phone! Only wish there were stereo speakers instead of just mono. Sound quality is only average when listening to music without earbuds. Processor is a bit underpowered, but that only matters if you're a serious gamer & insist on playing only the largest, most graphically complex games available. Otherwise, you won't even notice. Everything works the way it's supposed to, right out of the box. Great display, awesome battery, great sound (with earbuds), quick fingerprint scanner, solid camera & Samsung Pay is super convenient! Fast charging feature really makes a BIG difference!! This was my first phone purchased from Amazon & the experience has been great so far!***Value for money with great features. Loud speaker is a bit low. Otherwise the phone is very good. I am very happy as my old phone is exchanged at better price and I got a very good phone as replacement.Dual sim is not working. Only one sim is detected***Plus points:-1. Picture quality is Great.2. Sound Quality is also Great.3. Phone looks Costly.Minus Point:-1. Battery can be Better so cut one star.2. Little bit disappointed in sunlight.However, Over all performance of phone is awesome & I personally would like to recommend others.***",

  "cust_review": "Firstly, I am glad I have purchased this phone!For people confused between xs and xs max, take the xs, why? because xs max doesnt give you more screen space, it just enlarges the icons and the text. Even after upgrading the ios to 12.0.1, there seems to be no difference, I think the screen could have been used to fit in more text compared to the Xs. having said that, im used to big phones, the Pixel 2xl, the 6sPlus, so if you are a big phone person, go for this phone with eyes closed.If you are confused between apple and android flagships, let me tell you, I was on HTC for 3 years, then shifted to iphone 6s plus for 3 years and briefly shifted to pixel 2 xl, and  now finally to Xs Max, which I intend to use for the next 3 years. having used both, I definitely feel iphones are quite premium and offer the best tech. I mean when I think about it, who invented face ID? who designed the notch? Almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology, the other phones are going a step ahead, so definitely, apple is the trend setter! Comparing pixel 2xl with Xs Max, I found that the pixel 2 xl and even the pixel 2 get damn hot, definitely not the issue on the iphone. Iphone looks much better too! GREAT DISPLAY! Also great touch interface! its really smooth. Having said that, Its all personal choice!I really love my purchase! and now I know why some people are reluctant to switch to android from iphone!***Despite ordering the world class mobile, vibration function is not working since day one. Had gone through blogs and there was hope that it be a software issue and will get fixed. But unfortunately 2 months are over and even with the latest iOS 12.1.2, vibration function not working. I work in Nigeria and now do not know how to get it replaced.***The iPhone XS Max combines a big OLED screen, great speakers, great cameras, great battery life, and blazing fast speed into the best user experience on a smartphone. For the record, Apple will support this phone with software updates for 5 years...the Note 9 is a 2018 phone running 2017 Android software and Samsung gives software updates for 3 years. I\u2019ll list some pros and cons and also what the tech media won\u2019t tell you.Pros:- battery life is all day- upgraded speakers get real loud- Face ID is faster- fast and smooth- Siri has been given shortcuts- upgraded cameras are just as good as Samsung cameras now and the front camera is better than the Note 9 front cameraCons:- expensive- slow speed charger- no headphone jack- it\u2019s made of glass on the front and back. A case is almost mandatory especially if you are clumsyBottom line...the iPhone and Galaxy phones are the best phones on the market right now. The iPhone is a step ahead because iOS gets frequent updates and starting with iOS 12 Apple actually sped up old iPhones and iPads which will allow users to keep their devices longer. An iPhone is now like a laptop and something you only need to upgrade once it breaks. The iPhone is also the ONLY smartphone that can stream all video apps in full screen. Android doesn\u2019t have full screen built into the OS so video apps like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, STARZ, Encore, and EPIC are all tiny on the Note 9...those apps are all full screen on the iPhone. Food for thought.***Superb iphone battery life is soo good buy it for 104000***It\u2019s a must upgrade from iPhone 5S to iPhone 7. Excellent speed and battery life and everyone knows about camera quality. No doubt those who can\u2019t afford it will never have a chance to use this phone. These people are everywhere crying out loud about price tag, but once you buy it and use it you will know it\u2019s worth. Amazon is excellent in delivering packages securely to customers.***Not doubt, it is expensive and luxury product.However you will have experience of different levelFrom 6.00 am to 12.00  pm it consumes 80 % batteryI could say only one thing if have drove super bike like Harley Davidson or super car like aston, then only u could understand difference in experience between Aston/Harley to maruti800/splendor***",

  "cust_review": "NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7\") and XR the biggest(6.1\"), with X and XS with same size(5.8\"), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps.***Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.***Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon***So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there\u2019s a glitch in the front camera\u2019s portrait mode. That\u2019s fine, it may happen. But what\u2019s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!***It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I\u2019m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.***The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you.***Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon***",

  "cust_review": "Okay ; if you are reading this , you must be buying this 6s in 2018 onwards.So honestly , this is what I thought when I ordered it 6 months back. I have been through all the reviews and then I was so sure that yes i really should order this and , i am so happy with my choice now.Product review:1. Battery life: I was not sure with this thing when I bought it; but believe me this product I have is better in terms of battery life than my android (coolpad note 3). Can go 2 days with normal usage  on a single go.2. Picture quality: It is so amazing. I have been using it for my YT videos. And I found no problem at all .3. Hang issue: None yet4. Money: I got it for 34k , when it comes to apple; they do charge a lot. But believe me with this they provides lot of good quality as well.And if you are reading this , you sure don\u2019t have money issues.5. Apps: I didn\u2019t pay for a single app untill the day, and forget what other says , apple is amazing .Conclusion:Buy this product for sure, dont worry about model ; 6s is forever. Not too expensive like x series and still have all the features.Hope this will help.Let me know if you need more help.***My headset and charger were duplicates..can someone help me getting the original one***The good things about the iPhone 6s: Camera is excellent in the daylight, 3D-touch is butter smooth, good sound quality, look wise a perfect piece, battery charges very quickly, and also earphone sound is very good and so many good security and other features which I Ioved in the iPhone.The bad thing is only the battery, which is average (1 day for the average user). Overall a good purchase, go for it in a GIF.***Very good camera quy***Had purchased this phone to gift my wife on 1st Feb 2019. On 2nd Feb 2019 got some disturbance of network occurs. We though it could be a network problem. So We wait for it & tried with different networks calling from different location where other phones were working fine. But unfortunately issues was still there.We contacted Amazon as it was under 10 days replacement policy directly from Amazon. They guided us to visit service center to get job deny job sheet from them ( according to them it was a standard process & guidelines from Apple).ALthough it was very painful to visit service center just after three days of purchase of this handset. But we did it. After getting inspection from them they told us that there is no issue with device but problem is with sim card, although it was the same sim which we were using earlier in small keypad phone ( sound & network were amazing at my home & other locations).but still we changed sim card & used it for some days, but issue is still there.As per amazon we have to get job deny job sheet from Apple. As per Apple they wont give it as it can be repair after open the set.But how  can i allow them to open the set within three days of purchase.It is very painful, this is my third purchase of iPhone from Amazon. We never expect these kind irresponsible response from Amazon & Iphone both.We are not purchasing any Iphone from Amazon from now onward.***Really awesome phone... and original mobile... thanxxxx amazon and apple... camera result is awesome...***Super product and quick and safe deliveryFuffy satisfied***A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great.***",

  "cust_review": "Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here***The phone is okay. I am using it for like past 2 weeks. Runs smooth and fast. But two times the phone got hanged and I had to remove the battery to restart the phone. Battery backup is okay. Fast charging looks good. Both cameras are neat. Didn't run any heavy apps or games. Any overheating situations didn't occurred till this time. Fingerprint scanner works cool and fast. But sometimes right to left swipe end up showing the home screen. I don't know, may be it is because of the improper swipe.***Don't waste your money on this senseless and useless product....this mobile has severe heating issues and it is restarting automatically***Not as expected. Better mobile phones are available at this price. I will suggest not to go for this. The worst thing about this set is it takes more than 2 minutes to switch on and takes too long time to get fully charged. There are many more features which i didnot like in this handset.***bought moto g5, as screen size is 5 inch, thinking it will be small compared to moto g5s plus, but not much small in size visually, in width both mobiles are same size, length its smaller (only width of our finger nail..hahaha). But as capacity lower, by ram, and processor, and rom, its weight differs good, not as heavy weight as moto g5s plus.***never buy this. Very bad experience in terms of producrt and the repairing centre people misbehaved me.I bought the product 9 months back and it hardly fall 2 time and the body damaged completely and one day normally in my hand the phone got switched off and never revice again. I went to the authorised service centre at Moradabad and those people misbehave me, and ask me Can;'t you care properly your phone and didn't even respond properly. Please don't buy this product as MOTO G Though I trusted it to be reliable brand but really this is horrible experience..***Phone has a major issue of battery life.Battery doesn't stay for.even a day and  needs to be charged frequently.Also the phone eats up a lot.of storage space by built in apps Expected better product at this price***I think it was my biggest mistake to buy this phone. It is almost dead.This phone got slow overtime and atlast restart again and again. And says boot failure. I tried to reset and all but nothing works. I gave this in service centre but after one month of repair they said it can't be repaired. Moto cheat me . And phone is like in coma***",

  "cust_review": "Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India***i received defective iphone 7 32GB silver colour during \"Great Indian Festival Sale 2018\".Amazon delivered the product in a Day.But Product seems to be non functional. as Rear camera get Freeze due to faulty camera sensor. Just to save the time & money, i bought it from Amazon online E-store. Now Amazon representative, asked me to visit Apple Service store. So far i have wasted my precious time & my mind . The phone was sold by \"Sold by Appario Retail Private Ltd \" .I'm really fed up till now. expecting Amazon to do quick action against it.***First of all one would want to know is the product genuine and not refurbished coz during Amazon Big Sale I got it for 35k.Before unboxing the I checked up at Apple website and Online check with serial no , EMEI no and other detailsAnd it was 100% genuine and new Handset.Phone is working greatDelivery was also quick in 03 days ..***I want my refund money , because this product is not working properly, sound quality is not good, scrolling and switch problem.I called to many time to customer  care but no response and no body is taking responsibility.My personal request do not buy  any  product from Amazon.in .Really bad experience.Better to go for shopping from Flip cart.***I phone is the best phone but battery is notGood***This iPhone7 is in hearing problems. What Can I do***Thanks for Amazon service. phone is very nice and cool also is the display was very very cool the sound clarity is excellent and phone is very slim. And the processor is very fast Nice performance in gaming. Compare to other phones this is superb.***Coming from oneplus 3, this phone has been a great upgrade. Always wanted to know why the iOS is so popular. Well it is because it never disappoints. I am writing this review one year after purchasing it and it works like a charm. Still. I don\u2019t feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great.The only problem is the battery life which isn\u2019t enough for a complete day.***",

  "cust_review": "Worst phone that I have ever seen..5000 Mah battery is trap. I want to return this if possible.. Sensors are worst.... I'd repaired for once but also no battery no sensors are working better..***I was placed order for new, but I have received a set where date and time already defined, and a photo is in gallery which was captured on 22 May, 2017. + the gionee seal was broken + SIM  ejector has not found in box.  SET IS ALREADY USED***I totaly dislike this phone.and i think duplicate..the problem is software in which in every minute cut my money due to msg cost ..and i off my number than jio 100msg finished within 2hrs.. And in another all phone both sim work well... I replace mobile but still problem in another piece also***I had high expectations from this product. The battery life is good however not very happy with its performance. It hangs up on regular intervals, at time the incoming call are unable to be picked. The tap screen doesn't work. There are quite a few mandatory apps inbuilt  which I don't need but I cannot delete them. With Google Play available, smart phone manufacturers should provide only the basic apps. I may not buy Gionee again.***Like cordials glass display.....5000mah battery....3d photo....matal body.....64gb memory...4gb ram***Amazing phone in a such priceGreat battry lifeBeautiful design and look***Nice product in a nice price***Heavy to take, not hand friendly.Rest all is perfectly good to go.***",

  "cust_review": "Got it. Used it. AND AFTER ONE WEEK IT GOT HANGED. MOTOROLA LOGO ON THE SCREEN. AND STUCK. IT WAS LIKE THAT FOR 8 HOURS AND THEN IT WAS ALL OK. REALLY CONCERNED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS OCCURS ONCE THE RETURN WINDOW IS CLOSED. THE SMART CHECK APP IS NOT SHOWING ANY DEFECT AS RIGHT NOW PHONE IS WORKING WELL AND AMAZON TECH SAYS THAT I HAVE GOT 4 MORE DAYS TILL RETURN WINDOW, SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY WILL THINK ABOUT REPLACEMENT. THAT'S A JOKE. TRUST UR VALUABLE CUSTOMERS WORDS. WE DONT HAVE TIME TO CALL U AND WASTE OUR TIME. THIS ISSUE IS GENUINE. I LIKE MOTO HOWEVER I AM REALLY NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT I GOT. THERE IS GOT TO BE AN ISSUE WITH IT. READ MY COMMENT AND DO SOME ACTION AMAZON ASAP.***After oreo update...camera portrait doest work...even vedio stabilization ...and battery drain fast..***Really amazing productIt as same as the specifications were written.Value For MoneyGood in UseBattery last LongAnd amazing qualityPacking was also an amazingReached safely to my address.***I got my parcel today..The phone looks so fresh. great feature it has. Camera quality is decent.The only thing that disappointed me is earphone :( .my earphones are not working.Can I get another pair of earphones form nearer store ?***Got this device a week back and its heating a lot even while using normal apps like youtube.On top of this amazon is not accepting replacement.. was instructed to download Blanco app to diagnose issue but thats not helpful.I have been told that temperature till 44 degree is okay but its not you can't use phone at this temperature.***I love this phone and i am glad i bought it. From a very long time, i wanted to buy it but didn't have enough money but finally bought on 17 May 2019 for 13,000. I was crazy for the sterling blue model and i also knew that it's 4/ 64 GB model will soon go out of stock. (6/ 64 GB is cheaper and not worth it, find on youtube why?).So, i went ahead an ordered it when a new seller came up with a lower price of 13K.I am not going to get in to detail, all the specs you can check online but i will tell you why i bought this.Exclusive features of this phone:- Stock android- Running on android P- Moto gestures- Metal and glass built- NFC- IP 68 certification- Great cameras with add on features- Dedicated bt 5 software for up to 4 device connectThough the biggest advantage is ip 68 rating for water and dust resistance. During college I had to travel through dust and somehow it was able to pass through the speaker and accumulate on front camera, and once i even water damaged my phone. So, i know it's importance. This feature is not even present in 50,000 \u20b9 OP 6T Mclaren Edition.Performance is great and wifi speed is like rocket. I don't even see the download bar for small app downloads. Don't fall for benchmark score as they does not indicate the real life performance. However, if you will be gaming, i will recommend to get a phone with SD 675 or 710 and if it's not in your budget, then SD 660 is not too bad. If you want to make the phone even better, go to developer options and turn down all 3 animation scale to 0.5x3000 mAh battery might sound bad, but this is more than sufficient for a day. To keep the battery healthy, only install limited apps, turn off auto update, don't charge beyond 80% and use Power saver if needed. If you are on android 9, turn on battery saver mode and use it just for backup, it will stand by for up to 5 days or may be 7, if not used at all.The only thing i find bad, is the big bezels and unnecessary moto logo beneath the speaker which takes a lot of space. and finger print scanner speed is not that fast, but it's front mounted which is a good thing, so i won't complain.Finally my message to Motorola is instead of metal and glass glass body, you should've provided plastic body, and may be a 3600 mAh battery for the same price. That is what people want.Processor is ok for general use and casual gaming, but seriously you need to up the battery capacity to at least 3500 mAh, and don't change the speaker and fingerprint reader placement in your upcoming phones.***I love this phone, it's beauty and features as well. Nice design and looks very beautiful and it's performance is very good.***Battery life is pretty good thanks to turbo chargingCamera is good with day light but avg in artificial lighting. selfies are v good. I didn't like potrait mode.Performance is v good no lag while palying pubg and with multi tasking. Fingerprint sensor is also v fast. Heating while charging is due to turbo charging. And a bit heating while playing games and its normal for every metal bodied phone.Waterproof: no warranty for water damages. I didn't test waterproof but it is water-resistance.Display is v good bright and vibrant. One hand use is perfect.Style is v good. go for Sterling blue color. Buy a cover too cause back is glass too.Speaker output is also v good. Loud and very clear. Headphones are also v good.Great value for money I bought it on great indian festival I got it for RS 12300. For that money it values v much.***",

More like holding a big phone with no battery.# Battery backup is incredible. On above average use, there will be still 30% or more juice.# Metallic body is a life saviour.# Camera is fast to load a take continous quick snaps.# Front flash comes in handy.# Display is so beautiful.  online videos are vivid.# Front facing speakers is a great thumps up.

  "cust_review": "Extremely poor quality device. Within 6 months of usage the device started giving a problem of repeated restarting and freezing. The service center staff is incompetent. They havent been able to diagnose the problem. They updated the software and replaced the motherboard, and still the problem persists. Now the service center refuses to accept the device. Thoroughly disappointed. It is better to buy a cheap priced MI device rather than going for Lava. Its a disgrace that Dhoni endorses such a cheap quality product***I used it only for 3 months Worst phone facing charging problem and many more you can buy another branded smartphone at this price like samsung and motorola at the same price range..And worst service centre of lava company***The phone I received was a defective peice. The flashlight glass is no there. In the beginning itself if it's like that then what will be it's future. And the phone is getting heated very much.***Good mobile but we can get more mobile in this price like Redmi 5, Honor 7a***Good specs but hangs quite a lot and becomes unresponsive in the middle of doing something.***Low quality, delayed touch response, software/application hanging issue,charger get faulty in 4 months.***The product suddenly goes into a dead screen right after first month of purchase.poor quality product***Quality not good like accessories***",

I could control like select playlist, change track form my inbuilt car stereo.Picture quality is awesome. I like that I can shoot raw.Battery last the whole day.***I chose iPhone plus because I have low vision and found it difficult to read messages , mails in my iphone5s. I like the phone, silver in coliour . The picture quality is better than the previous versions.

  "cust_review": "Best phone.... An iPhone is an iPhone... Like no other!***Finally I decided to go with Apple as it now has an LED screen instead of IPS LCD screens that Iphone 8+ and previous versions had.. ( I also used my dads iphoneX for around 2 months and decided to go for this when I was convinced) Though it is expensive, i believe its worth the money.. I feel its much more secure than Android and its not forcing me to have Facebook, Youtube etc that my Previous Samsung phones always did... Just to let y\u2019ll know that I was a big fan of samsung.. I have used Note 1,2,3,4,8 S4, S7 edge etc.. Though its screen was good.. they use to slow down after some time of use.. I purchased an Apple only after positive reviews from my friends and I am loving this so far.. 3 GB RAM in iphone x or 4 GB RAM here in iPhone XS is far better than 6 GB ram in a Samsung.. I also play PUBG and I am also loving the Gaming experience.. Very important, it runs on High graphics mode where as my Note 8 use to work on medium graphics even when I used the mobile on Gaming, High performance or Entertainment mode... So, I am loving my iPhone so far..And the face ID is just awesome...***Too much .. just too much \u2018heating \u2018Same in hands as iPhone X***As a tech and apple enthusiast : This is one beautiful piece of tech and engineering marvel . From its seem less design to its attention to minute details (thx to the designing team behind it) , it will force you to agree that its insane price tag is justified the moment you hold it . I can never believe myself  of how much my views have changed about this product and Apple from it release to the moment I had it in my hands .Well if you want to know specs and comparisons well you have youtube , there are plenty of reviews there but if you are ready to buy such an expensive piece without selling your kidney then those reviews and comparisons don't matter to you I guess .My review :Camera : trustworthy , reliable , takes very aggressive HDR shots at times but generally neutral with its performance , you will find yourself editing the pictures a lot and I never complained it as I love doing it and when the base material is so detailed and accurate to begin with that you never lose any significant amount of quality after many editing cycles .Battery : Respectable AF ! Never expected this from a sub par capacity battery , while it is not the best , its at a very respectable position for sure  , it surely will surprise you once you use it .Speed : The king of phones in speed period .Design : 10/10Negatives - Face ID doesn't work in landscape , Charges slow .***Disappointed due the Camera of Xs (In low light/indoor photography face output will be totally artificial). In comparison with my old iPhone6s, I vote for 6s for low light/indoor photography. (I am not talking about selfie camera issue. I identified issue with main camera)Contacted Apple service centre and their response is \u201cthat is how iPhone X & iPhone Xs designed\u201dRaised issue to Apple customer care number and shared the sample pics and other required data to analyse. Apple customer care came back to me after a week asking pictures by providing multiple scenarios. I have seen similar post for iPhone Xs MAX with the same issue in apple forum and the final response from Apple is: check lighting while taking pics.I am not sure why very less people has raised this issue in Xs Camera reviews (started digging more and observed in reviews only after facing the issue)Please note that, iPhone can\u2019t be returned to Amazon without the approval from Apple. Apple don\u2019t agree it\u2019s as issue. Totally disappointed.This might be best Camera in some scenarios, but for me it\u2019s a total disappointment.***Feeling cheated. Nothing wrong with the product. But i saw an ad on insta mentioning iphone xs max 256gb at 1.09 nd here i have an iphone xs 256gb.I dearly wanted an xs max model and now there are not ready to exchange even if i am ready to buy a new one.***Personally i feel the XS is a complete phone. My last Iphone 6 worked flawlessly for 3 yearsI was confused between note 9, xs, one plus 6T and other latest handsets.Finally chose IOS over android as it is more polished than android and the apps in my opinion work better on an IOSDid not go for the Max as i prefer the smaller size.Price is definitely high and i got it in a nice deal from amazon which knocked off 20k on the price tagPlus got free screen replacement cover, no interest EMITips:Wait for a SALE to get maximum savings. This phone is worth it if you are getting it at a good deal. get a cover***While purchasing the item it has been shown that it comes under no EMI cost. But when I received my first credit card statement it shows EMI amount plus interest plus GST cost. Pls clarify.***",

Keep it up Amazon for delivering it in one day's time through normal delivery.***6\" full HD display,and features are good,my parents love this android phone***Very good phone for the given rate. Camera quality is average, charging is slow but then battery lasts very long. Lags during gaming sometimes but otherwise ot works flawlessly. Very loud sound woth dolby atmos. Beautiful amoled screen. Just be careful to immediately put a screen guard and cover on it since the glass is very delicate both front and back. A lot of scratches already on my screen***What I like-1. Amazing display2. Good battery life3. Looks like a premium phone way above it's price range4. Good user interfaceWhat I don't like-1. Can be slow and laggy if you've got more than a few apps runningVerdict: I bought this phone since I only use whatsapp, chrome , youtube and spotify. It  serves my basic needs as a daily driver and does the job reasonably well. However, if you're going to multitask or even run a simple game, it's gonna lag like hell. The phone is on the slower side of things so do bear that in mind.***Better***Very good mobileValue for moneySound is also goodCamera is also goodBest mobile***Phone is slow and especially the calling function is too slow. This is my 4 th Samsung phone and first time I am facing this issues very unsatisfying***I love Samsung product even now a days as many products in the market.actually worth is Samsung.***",

  "cust_review": "The power bank worked well for less than 3 months. Then it stopped charging altogether. I called the customer care number and was told that since it is in warranty it will be replaced post checking at the service center. Service center first said.  It's charging. I told them to keep it on charge for a bit and see, it would not go beyond one light out of 4. They realized I was right and then proceeded to tell me that since there is a small dent in the corner on the body of the power bank they cannot replace it! Really? How come the dent didn't matter before they realised it was charging? On asking for their opinion on the situation in writing, they refused. Really bad service from Mi. Am never buying another Mi product again. They are cheats of the first order.***This is maybe my 10th personal power bank. I have used Anker, Adata, Plantronics, Ambrane, Intex, generic ones, iWalk and more. Most of them promise too much but by keeping the price tag low, you end up losing on genuine quality and assured performance. With the Mi Power Bank, you get what is promised. This is one difference that I noticed. The power bank was mostly charged when I needed it to be charged and after having used it for 30 days, I can safely say it has a great capacity of holding the charge.What phones & devices does this charge for me?S8 Plus, iPhone 8, Fitbit Blaze (once a week) and my Amazon Fire TV when I don't have a power plug to plug it.Does it fast charge?Yes, it fast charges the S8 Plus. This means it saves me the time and hassle of connecting with the wall charger. Yes, the wall charger is still little faster as wall charger uses 2.1 A charging and this uses 2.0 A charging (I think) but this is a major positive.Can it be used to charge two devices?The good news is that the 3-4 times I have used this with both devices, I have not seen any reduction in performance quality. It keeps the power going and seems to be able to support it. If its fast charging in one, then it is giving consistent charge to the other slot too.How often do I Charge it?Maybe once a week. Not more than a maximum of twice a week.Can it charge a macbook?I tried to use this and in one hour it only adds 12% to my Macbook Pro Touchbar 13\" so it is not worth it.How long does it last?Lets say it will charge both my phones maybe 7-8 times in total before giving up.Who should get this?IF you have one phone and it dies easily, you should get this as this will keep it charged. I suggest you charge only till 85% and then disconnectif you have two phones, this is a good deviceHow long does it take to charge? I have never measured it. But with the accompanied cable and my Samsung Fast Charger Adapter, it charges in 6 hours to 100%. This is not bad for me as I plug it in overnight.Drawback? Mi is a Chinese company and I feel a little bad for using it. But the product is good if you forgive the political inferences. Thanks.***Been using this product for a week.Had bought it for my Redmi Note 5Pro which has a battery capacity of 4000 mAh.Now, things to keep in mind:1. Most important- Capacity of the battery is 20,000 mAh but actual power is 13000 mAh (As claimed by Mi on the website) due to conversion loss.So technically it should charge my Phone for 3 full cycles, so does it?The answer is YES, which is a big thumbs up from my side.2. can simultaneously charge 2 devices (just did a casual test, worked fine)3. Throughout the week I tested it for my phone only using a single port which triggered Qualcomm 3.0 fast charge & it heated my device (Not very much but acceptable).I have attached a screenshot of the quick charging icon visible when phone is connected to a single port on the powerbank4. Bcoz of the bulky size, putting an external cover for gripping is advisable.I purchased a silicon cover separately for it.5. Has overcharge & short-circuit protection (Company claimed).6. Not pocket friendly.Overall i am happy with the purchase considering the price to performance ratio.Would definitely recommend to anyone who travel or require an external backup source.***I am using it  since 6 months and trust me the power holding capacity of this particular power bank won't ever disappoint you! Since its of 10k mAh its quite heavy as its from Xiaomi. It takes enough time to charge itself but trust me once its fully charged it will not going to get discharge on standby as most of the power bank does, here's a buying tip for you if the sales are about to come than wait for it and purchase it on sale ;)***Procs -1. Good material2. Good backup / battery life3. Excellent built quality4. Light weight5. Extra slim as mobile6. Better charging speed at two mobile at a time7. Durable due to aluminum body8. Value for money 699/- ( 630/-)Cons -1. Worst re-charging speed  it takes around 8-10 hours2. No Type-C option or variant3. No Type-C connector including in box4. No LED Torch optionI give 4 star out of 5.***Pros: affordable, long life, goos charging speed, great metal feelCons: not very impact resistant, bad durability charging cable provided, average packagingSummary : very good product and all the products can be taken care of by just handling well.

Such a lame business tactics!It's not the absence of the cable, but the feeling of being cheated by not mentioning about it anywhere predominantly.I gifted this to someone just to feel embarrassed of myself when he opened the gift.What's next? Selling mobile phones without batteries!***It does charge the phone quickly. Truely a 2 amp fast charger. Please note that there is no cable with it and one has to buy it separately at an extra cost. MI cable is expensive at 300 Rs so I bought a Micromax cable at 150 which is good.***It's original and only adaptor. No cable comes with this product.***Fast delivery by amazon thanks to amazon \ud83d\ude0dNice charger. M satisfied \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb***It advertises the output as 5V=2A; however, real world experience is much less. Actual output is 0.725 Amp or 725 milliamperes. Not a good charger.***nice charger and original brand. close the eyes and place the order. I guarantee for this item :)***Worst Product don't buy it. Seller will not provide you cable. Moreover, that charger is also not good enough (it's not fast charger at all) and only 1 month it passed off and my charger is damaged. Didn't expected such thing. Think twice before buying. And let me clear your doubts all those reviews were paid reviews. I bought this product by seeing the reviews, now it's your choice your money.***Worth the money. Product seems to be original as it comes in Mi certified packing. Works on Redmi note 4. USB port. Adapter only.***",

  "cust_review": "The product seems to work well but look at both the Amazon and the MI.com website and the replacement filter is constantly out of stock- what's the point if one can't get the air filter easily***Filter remaining shows as 99% in couple of mins of first usage my pm level it was showing < 10 it's now showing 98% within just 4hrs usage. Pollution levels are way less than 30***Overall it looks good, easy to install and operate with scheduled or auto mode , good build quality etc but Price is on the upper side i think, 5-6K ideally.Now the review  - So I got it 3 weeks back and hardly used for 4-5 days. for the first two days i was excited with the features and display etc but later i found it of not much useful in Bangalore climate. the AQI reading is mostly between 20-45. it jumps from 20 to 40 in no time and vice versa in a partially closed room environment, not sure it should behave this way or an issue with the sensor.  the low AQI indicates good air quality so I am not worried much about turning it on everyday. one day it worked as expected when some kitchen smoke filled the room it shown red indicator and fan speed increased. I have experienced a sore throat after switching it on for full night for two days near my bed.Overall its useful for people stay in foggy area with worst air quality, current Bangalore climate doesn't warrant one, the upcoming winter might need though.***I was initially skeptical about this purifier - but so far it hasn't disappointed. Design is sleek and modern. Showed a PM2.5 of more than 300 (in Delhi house) and got it down to <70 within 30 minutes. The display also shows the remaining life of the filter (manual says it should last 3-6 months before a replacement is reuquired). There is also a night mode for more quiet operation.Wifi setup to the app is not as seamless as I would have liked - it took 3 attempts for it to finally connect to the app through the WiFi. However, app connectivity is not mandatory for its functioning. So not a big issue.Will need to see how durable it is in the long run, but so far I am happy with the purchase.***In 4 days the filter went from 100 to 97 percent.  I think we have to change the filter every two months at least for my usage. My room is totally air-conditionied room with and almost sound proof.  Even the value of quality of air was 1 or 2. Even though the filter is being consumed very aggressively.  I do not recommend.***Product looks nice and is portable. Its a clever design with circular filter.No need to change 2 separate filters as its all integrated into a single filter.Smart app to control and monitor your Air purifier.App will notify when the filter needs a replacement.Schedule the Purifier to turn on and off automatically at a given time.App sync is easy and is done within seconds( xiaomi probably fixed this issue as some customers were having trouble with the app )Pros:* All in one single cylindrical filter - Easiest replacement* Display sensor for PM 2.5 level, temperature and humidity* Smart App connection - Schedule the device to turn on and off and monitor it on your phone.* Replacement filter costs 2100/- and very easy to change in 30 seconds !* High CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) 310 m3/hrCons* Difficult to clean the filter* Noisy in manual mode***this is my second purchase. I own air 2 as well. There is definitely less polluted air when you leave it running overnight. You get to know about it by noticing transparent mucus in nose instead of black matter we generally notice while cleaning our nostrils.However, does it clean 99.97% pollutants. I don't think so, it takes lot of time (upto 2 hours) to bring down pollution under 100 in a 13 x 11 room (closed outdoor air vents/windows).Plus, take a look at closeup of air flow vent. I can see black dust building up on grill. If it was clean air, there would not be any residue build-up there.***#Pros- Easy to install, compact and easy to lift.- Elegant looking and blends nicely with the room interior.- Effective (Brings down the indoor air quality PM 2.5 level from ~210 to 60-70 within 15 minutes)- PM2.5 level indicator is realistic I guess (the level goes up if some it detects smoke)- Smart equipment and can be controlled through phone and tablet or even alexa :).- I found the child lock really useful as my kid is no longer able to tamper the physical buttons.Cons:- Not sure about the durability and after sales service though as, this is my first ever MI purchase.***",

  "cust_review": "Value for your money. It is not a Porsche, not even an Ambassador, but what is under the hood is enough to take you around. Use it sensibly, without loading the most-demanding games and resource-intensive apps, then this should last you a really long time. What surprises me is that even the next expensive tablet down the line (if you want a brand name, Samsung's basic tabs) would cost twice the price and with the same specs and still feel a little tacky.I was a little apprehensive regarding the feedback from several other uses on Amazon that they had had problems with responsiveness and/or trouble with lag or hangs. From personal experience, I see that it is not true. Yes, the tab is underpowered compared to all the fab tabs that you can buy for 4x-10x times the price of this one. Well, isn't that the point? To my mind, this is good enough for all the basic stuff, is quite responsive, does not trouble you with lags. The purpose of buying a tab matters. In this case it is for study and learning. So most videos run just fine, kids can play a few basic games, the audio is not great, but should not matter. You are getting more than your money's worth. Just don't expect to take it out for a spin like you need to push it to its limits - for that, buy a Porsche, go on, I know you want to do it..***Tab was delivered with 2MP rear camera and 0.3MP front camera, instead of 8MP rear and 2MP front cameras. Appears to be a deliberate attempt to betray the buyers.  Photos turned out to be pathetic. Screen has poor touch-sensitivity and requires hard-tapping on the icons***Amazon has hidden critical information in the product description section about the type of SIM slot available for a calling tab such as whether it is a micro SIM or Normal SIM. When contacted Amazon customer care all they provide following solutions for resolution.1. As Normal SIM does not FIT cut your SIM and put it.2. We cannot provide SIM information for Voice Calling tab and it is Lenovo's responsibility to provide the same.3. Call us before buying any product and check.Dont buy this product if you have a normal SIM and amazon service is pathetic as described above.***If you are aiming to buy a best performance tab at low cost then this is the one you need to buyTill this date not a single malfunctionBattery standby is very goodBelieve it or not never had a single issue with this lenovo tabThanks to Amazon***I gifted this irem to my 11 years old son..he is saying that picure wality is very bad.even battery back up..tab is heating....The said cemara pixals and sented pxals are mismatching....plz dont purchase. Weste of money....better goto flipcart web. Prchase i ball slide enzo 8.

Reasons are premium built quality, good performance and the Apple brand name!***Received Iphone 8 Plus in 2 days but received European adapter***Camera is awesome, great battery life, bright colourful screen and fastest touch Id. The only issue I faced so far is size. It sometimes feels too big as I have always used smaller phones til this one came.***It's a beast.I m telling you guys.apple is giving u every penny for the phone.Just in love with this red.***I switched from apple iphone 7 to apple iphone 8 plus and believe me it\u2019s a drastic change plus size definitely gives u a big screen feel and its just perfectly amazing***",

I bought this mainly because of its case with side strip that allows one to see the key information as well as to accept and reject incoming calls. I have noticed a couple of downsides so far. 1. The case cover does not close snugly if it is fitted on top of the back cover. 2. The battery is also not that great. It drains quickly. I use a fast charger and the charging is not as fast as my other phone - LG G4. This battery quality problem could be because it is relatively cheaper phone. My recommendation on buying this K10 phone to my friends will be 'depends'.***I have purchased this mobile for Rs. 6024/-. I am so happy. Phone looks really so stunning. No complaints about this phone. If someone wants to buy... don't think. Just go for it.***Good product***Good one***Gets hang and cant even get switched off if we want when it hangs not absolutely as expected.***Not able to latch on 4G whereas same SIM working on other any 4G supported handset***Good quality***",

  "cust_review": "Pros:-* Best design among the true wireless  earbuds. Doesn't stick out of the ears.* Compact charging case. Fits easily into  your jeans pocket.* Type-C charging case also supports  wireless charging. (Future proof)* Fits perfectly in the ears. (Most of us don't  have symmetrical ear canals so change the  eartips accordingly)* Ambient sound mode works well.* 5 hours battery life of the earbuds is  among the best.Cons:-* The charging case is able to charge the  earbuds only once but then again it's a  trade off for size.* Only IP X2 rated. So not possible to use in  the rain.* No internal storage like the previous IconXI don't know about the audio quality on non-Samsung devices but I'm using it with the Galaxy S8 with Dolby Atmos ON (music), EQ- Jazz, EQ(Galaxy wearable app)- Dynamic and tweaked the audio settings (battery life might take a slight hit) in the 'Developer Options' (screenshot provided)The audio sounds just too good after this.It's totally worth the price.***This pair of earbuds are just awesome from every corner. Nice bass and connectivity. Features were stunning nice as the single and multi touch functions make it work smooth and it connects to my OP5 with no time lag...\ud83d\ude0d***I have got this from Amazon. First I tried connecting with MI note 5, I really got shocked that volume is very low when I played a song.Then I thought that to return this product.But when I spoke with support team of Amazon, they told to try with multiple devices.I tried with Samsung device, it was excellent. And iam very impressed by its sensor and tapping system,Battery quality,fast charging and more.But one thing is this earbuds will support efficiently only with Samsung phones.***I was confused between apple airpod gen 2 and galaxy buds,but when i went to the store croma and do the trial of apple airpod and found apple airpod is lacking in terms of sound quality except of calling quality,at the same time my friend has his galaxy buds,and you wont believe apple airpod are not sound good as galaxy buds.Under 10k u have wireless case and premium quality ear buds which is easy to customise with extra pairs of rubber buds according to the ear size.But in apple case u have to spend extra 8k to get wireless case,So i think its not worth to go for apple airpodBut only the problem is if you are a apple user then u cant have access features of samsung app where u can changes the settings of ear buds.So this time samsung has nailed the market in less money with more features***They connect wonderfully with the S9 and are very comfortable in the ear and give no fatigue.Sound quality is okay. You have to keep it on hight volume to get good sound.Touch controls are not very responsive. They are hit or miss but i dont use them much so i am okay.Microphone are pahetic. You cant have a decent conversation on a phone call. Its a shame because they are so comfortable if they would have given good phone call quality. I would have given 5 star rating if not for the pathetic microphones.***I don't know about quality of product because when product delivered me seal was broken there are 2 seal one is manufacturer seal and second is another manufacturer seal was broken***I always wanted to buy a True wireless headphone for my one plus and thought of having Samsung Buds as it was the \"BEST\" option available with type C but I was mistaken.The earphones sound very bad(2 out of 10).The MI wired  earphone for 399 sounded way better.Other issues are that one of the earphone losses its connectivity with the other.While using it with my laptop I can hear the sound echo as the buds are not truly synced and have some millisecond delay .Never the less here are some pros:1)Very Light Weight and dont fall off the ear at all.Great fit.2)Supports Type CCons1)Sound very bad(No great base or mids)2)Cracking sound while hearing music3)Earphones randomly disconnect4)The Left and the right loose sync and the sounds seem to echo.While using it with the phone in my pocket I often hear cracking sounds while a song is playing.Its a big disappointment and definitely not work the 10K price.***Writing this review after nearly 1 month of use with my Galaxy S8 Plus.1. Sound Quality - 3/5 without using Dolby Atmos mode.The moment you turn on that mode, this becomes 5/5.The best thing is you can use the Galaxy Wearable app to highly customize the sound quality depending on your listening style. I personally prefer Bass Boost mode.2. Design and Build - 5/5. These tiny cool looking buds will make you fall in love with them from the 1st day. With a number of cool features in them, they make the benchmark of your expectation.3. Call Quality - 4/5. Though managable, clarity is a bit low while on a call.4. Battery Life - 4/5. The buds can be used continuously for 6 to 7 hours. The only problem is case battery life is around 7 to 8 hours. I use them for 5 to 6 hours on a weekday. So I have to charge the case in every 2 to 3 days.Overall, the Galaxy Buds are a pretty good buy. If you own a Galaxy Phone and want to buy a mid to high range truely wireless earphones, don't think too much. This is the one for you.***",

Battery life is three days for me though I disturb it a lot. Speaking of durability it is prone to sratches, never mind it's decent not showing off.

The other things I liked were the Bluetooth that helped me in connecting the device with Bluetooth speakers and the USB connector as well as 3.5mm audio jack. I left the non wired FM too. Also you can have security app lock in default settings. OMG lots of features to a simple phone. Got this at 750\u20b9 I must be lucky. Lava I trust your brand now..Amazon too.

  "cust_review": "The best. I was not expecting this quality product from Mi. The sound is simply amazing and the best thing is the Bass. The sound at 100% is really loud enough, will fill up an average big hall. Coming to battery it's reasonable. Fill last about 3-4 hours at 100% volume and if used in 80% to 100% it lasts upto 4-5 hours. it doesn't come with battery indicator but for iOS, Redmi and Lenovo phones it will show the percentage in phone itself. I bought it for 1,799rs I wish it came for a bit cheap maybe 1,500. But for its size and compact ability it's really amazing.***I have been an MI fan but this speaker turned out to be a nightmare..Amazon packaging was so poor..Volume is just ok..it has been only a week or so.but NO BATTERY LIFE AT ALL..Doesn't get charged..NEED MY MONEY BACK***Plus this also shows battery level in your phone itself (if you're using Apple or Mi phones, otherwise you have to install an app called BatON; I'm in no way affiliated with this app and it may or may not work for you)Bass is good for a speaker this size, battery right now lasts for ~7 hours at 80% volume which is really good. This has 15 level volume. Range is pretty good at around 7 - 8 meters even with a wall in between.Build Quality is MIs strong suit in my opinion. Buttons have a good tactile feedback and metal feels really premium.Haven't found any cons right now but will update this review whenever I do.***Beautiful, compatible, looks premium, decent sound***Speaker has suicidal tendencies...dont keep it near table end....one good bass and it will push itself off the table...mi should add some grip to its base..***I liked the overall performance of this speaker. If specified, it is portable, not much, but very.. it's very portable. It's lightweight and doesn't slip off of hands.Big disadvantage (mostly for the people with lightning or type c lifestyle) is it doesn't come with micro usb cable... Yes, cable is not added in the box and you'll be ending up purchasing a new cable or borrowing one from your colleague(s).Anyway, it sounds good. Good for light music and the highs gets a little muffled when volume is turned up to more than 75 percent. Mids are nice and lows are okay. Bass could have been a bit heavy but it's okay for a fair use and for the price.3.8/5 stars overall***Best Bluetooth speaker . Strongly recommend . I got it in 1780/- only . Clear sound , very loud , bass booster , it runs 1 hour in low battery also. Only thing you have to be worry is it's grip on surface , it moves with high base sounds so try placing it well so it won't fall down.***I am writing this review after 3 months used and i found it great sound quality is goodLoud enough for a single roomBest thing is the battery backup if you r using it with 50% volume the battery will last long as 10 hours but if u r using in its full volume with bass then only 3 to 4 hours.***",

I dont know why some times it does heating and sometimes not, apart from this im really in beast mode to buy this phone..***Microphone worst quality***A very good phone. You can update to iOS12. Its fast.I\u2019m not an audiophile so the apple headphones are good enough for me. The adapter works well when I tried with my senheiser headphone. In my car I just plug the usb cable and it works. I could control like select playlist, change track form my inbuilt car stereo.Picture quality is awesome. I like that I can shoot raw.Battery last the whole day.***I chose iPhone plus because I have low vision and found it difficult to read messages , mails in my iphone5s. I like the phone, silver in coliour . The picture quality is better than the previous versions. Now I am able to read mails, watch videos on the bigger screen.It  is a boon for persons like me having impaired vision.***I have been using Apple iPhone 7Plus for last 18 months and there have been ZERO complaints so far.

  "cust_review": "I brought the phone on 31st May and by 12th sept I had to submit the phone at service centre as it stopped working suddenly.  I submitted my phone at Vashi telecom - PTS. They changed the motherboard and returned the phone after 3days. After recieving from service centre, the mic is not working properly. I went to the same service centre again and they said it is because of dust. They cleaned and returned the phone and after one day again I am facing the same issue. Highly disappointed with the phone. Paid so much and after 3 months I am running around service centres.***Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Most reviews have highlighted the Pro's very well - great looks, good camera, acceptable performance. I would like to point out the Con's that has come to my notice.1. Battery performance - Very bad. Turbo charge is over-rated. It does not charge in 15 minutes. It takes approx. 45-50 minutes to go from 20% to 100%. Charging is faster when battery is low. With time, charging speed slows down.Battery discharges pretty quickly too. It hardly lasts 25-30 hours despite the fact that I don't play mobile games or watch videos on my phone.2. I was using Lenovo Vibe K5 note before this phone. It was cheaper, but had some really handy tools which I miss badly in this phone. Example: Screenshot option in Quick access pull-down menu, Hands-free Gesture capture in Selfie camera, background app management in Settings->power manager which would allow me to customize completely which app can run in the background, which I cannot do here.3. Internal memory - Mine is a 32GB variant and when I unboxed the phone, more than 16GB is already being used by the system memory which is incredible! You cannot ever free this memory so 50% of your storage is gone even before you start using your phone.4. Notification lights - So Motorola has stopped providing notification lights, which means you have to turn the screen on every time to check if you have any new notification or if charging is complete. There are apps to fix this in the play store, and also a feature by Motorola which shows you notification every time you pick up the phone, but these options drain your already-depleted battery.5. Camera - I'll admit that the camera was the main reason why I bought this model. I have gone through numerous Youtube videos to assess the quality. I'm not using Google camera but the pre-loaded Camera app. I will not say that the camera is bad but it misses some very basic tools present in cheaper phones. Example: ability to click selfies without having to touch the screen (face-detection/hand-gesture/smile detection) and if you click selfie in portrait mode, then you cannot turn on face beauty feature, which means you have to choose any one between face beauty or bokeh mode, which is so crappy!6. Updates - This is not a con, rather an observation. I had to spend almost 4GB data and >4 hours updating this phone from Nougat to Oreo.Overall, I will say this is value for money because I bought it for just 11k.***Moto x4 awesome mobile.Best Camera.Best mobile feature.Best body.Fast charging.Only problem is while charging phone heats up.***\ud83c\udf47Battery life  18 hours without playing games..  only on using net like video and browsing..\ud83c\udf47Battery charger is good speed..  charging in half hour 80% of battery.,\ud83c\udf52 good screen and gorilla glass ..no problem with drop from hand..\ud83c\udf47Good looking and free handle with one hand.\ud83c\udf47PUBG game we can 4 hours only..\ud83c\udf47 Android pie update available..\ud83c\udf47 Overall is good.\ud83c\udf47Camera quality is good.\ud83c\udf47 Front camera excellentNegative is.

I like that I can shoot raw.Battery last the whole day.***I chose iPhone plus because I have low vision and found it difficult to read messages , mails in my iphone5s. I like the phone, silver in coliour . The picture quality is better than the previous versions. Now I am able to read mails, watch videos on the bigger screen.It  is a boon for persons like me having impaired vision.***I have been using Apple iPhone 7Plus for last 18 months and there have been ZERO complaints so far.

  "cust_review": "The oddly satisfying iPad and this is my first Apple product... This iPad is simply amazing... I bought it before a month... The edges are well protected and it's build quality is also good... Let's talk about pros and consPros:1) Processor: A12 bionic embedded with M12 co processor... The line itself makes everyone feel amazing because one of the fastest processors in the world and because of its nueral engine the optimization is superb and never experienced any problem.2)Battery life: If you are a gamer don't get so disappointed because for gaming it lasts upto 7hours of continuous gaming... And for normal users you can expect the battery life for 1 to 3 days depending upon your usage...3) Display: being a 226ppi retina display it is simply magnificent... Your eyes won't get damaged no need to worry at that point ... And thanks to it p3 wide colour gamut.4) Weight and Design: The interesting thing is it weighs only 456 grams no other mobile iPad feels this light. You won't get the feel of holding a large brick in your hand, you will like you are holding a thin 6.1mm paper.5) Camera: Compared to the latest 48 MP mobiles and tablets, this iPad rocks in day light. Both front and back are nice and performing wellCons:1) Charger: The power brick provided in the box to charge the iPad is somewhat disappointing... It's getting heat easily...2) Cable: Lighting cable is the unsatisfying thing and the quality of the cable is also somewhat disappointing... If it would have type c it would be a beast...That's it. It's a wonderful product compared to everything...***The Apple India app store is limited both in terms of apps and reviews. Also the pricing of apps compared to the US store is ridiculous. $0.99 apps are priced anywhere between Rs. 159 - 459.The device is still limited in app official support as it was released only in April 19. Also support for 1st gen Apple pencil is an irritant.Rear camera quality is also quite bad, as I'm yet to get a non grainy image.Don't bother getting the cellular version for ~15k more rather buy a JioFi + data for ~1.5k***If you are looking to replace your laptop from content consumption perspective, this is the perfect tablet. Even creation of content is viable up to a limit. The speed, response , sound, everything about this iPad is a marvel. I have the gold version of the same***I can\u2019t use iPad continuously for at least one hour. That much heat make me suffer. Really I appreciate for the weight (that\u2019s why named AIR). Because even it\u2019s weight near to half kg (10.5inch! Display), it can easily hold on one hand (if you didn\u2019t use cover) due to weight spread. I really wonder about the display, it\u2019s awesome (true tone). I didn\u2019t play any heavy graphics game or heavy usage in my iPad (due to heat), so i can\u2019t judge about the speed. Heat issue completely collapse their other important work. At the time of purchase I really got some problems in switching apps and other some minor issues. Now it\u2019s cleared after the update from apple. So now also I believe after one or more (few) update, the heating issue will be cleared.  Whatever it is, I really disappointed (as a apple fan(user)) about iPad Air.***iPad is Awesome... But security options are poor to protect from hacking by other apple devices. Touchid is not working properly. Passcode dependent to unlock your device...Lengthy recovery, if we have single apple device when forgot password/passcode***What a very convenient device this is! Absolutely fantastic experience. I\u2019ve purchased the Smart Keyboard as well and I\u2019d say the combo is really good to use. Way better than any laptop IMO if your purpose is not for coding/gaming.***Overall its good. Thanks.***After using ipad 4 for 7 years it was a real perfect upgrade for me as now ipad is offering better utility functions and good battery is also a plus point***",

Just the look of the phone is good***Speed is not as per 6GB Ram***Best in this range from as well known camera to performance....about gaming it is good apart from gaming it's better to have it a light weight and awesome body design cell.***Excellent phone you can go for it***Working fine***It's Just Awesome, as this phone launched last year i took this immediately after launch. I am using this more than a year now all features of this phone are just amazing... Perfect sound quality, perfect camera, perfect speed & look of this phone is just aswesome... I love it\u2665\ufe0f***Camera quality excellent. Sound, screen everything superb. I like it lot.***",

  "cust_review": "Best phone.... An iPhone is an iPhone... Like no other!***Finally I decided to go with Apple as it now has an LED screen instead of IPS LCD screens that Iphone 8+ and previous versions had.. ( I also used my dads iphoneX for around 2 months and decided to go for this when I was convinced) Though it is expensive, i believe its worth the money.. I feel its much more secure than Android and its not forcing me to have Facebook, Youtube etc that my Previous Samsung phones always did... Just to let y\u2019ll know that I was a big fan of samsung.. I have used Note 1,2,3,4,8 S4, S7 edge etc.. Though its screen was good.. they use to slow down after some time of use.. I purchased an Apple only after positive reviews from my friends and I am loving this so far.. 3 GB RAM in iphone x or 4 GB RAM here in iPhone XS is far better than 6 GB ram in a Samsung.. I also play PUBG and I am also loving the Gaming experience.. Very important, it runs on High graphics mode where as my Note 8 use to work on medium graphics even when I used the mobile on Gaming, High performance or Entertainment mode... So, I am loving my iPhone so far..And the face ID is just awesome...***Too much .. just too much \u2018heating \u2018Same in hands as iPhone X***As a tech and apple enthusiast : This is one beautiful piece of tech and engineering marvel . From its seem less design to its attention to minute details (thx to the designing team behind it) , it will force you to agree that its insane price tag is justified the moment you hold it . I can never believe myself  of how much my views have changed about this product and Apple from it release to the moment I had it in my hands .Well if you want to know specs and comparisons well you have youtube , there are plenty of reviews there but if you are ready to buy such an expensive piece without selling your kidney then those reviews and comparisons don't matter to you I guess .My review :Camera : trustworthy , reliable , takes very aggressive HDR shots at times but generally neutral with its performance , you will find yourself editing the pictures a lot and I never complained it as I love doing it and when the base material is so detailed and accurate to begin with that you never lose any significant amount of quality after many editing cycles .Battery : Respectable AF ! Never expected this from a sub par capacity battery , while it is not the best , its at a very respectable position for sure  , it surely will surprise you once you use it .Speed : The king of phones in speed period .Design : 10/10Negatives - Face ID doesn't work in landscape , Charges slow .***Disappointed due the Camera of Xs (In low light/indoor photography face output will be totally artificial). In comparison with my old iPhone6s, I vote for 6s for low light/indoor photography. (I am not talking about selfie camera issue. I identified issue with main camera)Contacted Apple service centre and their response is \u201cthat is how iPhone X & iPhone Xs designed\u201dRaised issue to Apple customer care number and shared the sample pics and other required data to analyse. Apple customer care came back to me after a week asking pictures by providing multiple scenarios. I have seen similar post for iPhone Xs MAX with the same issue in apple forum and the final response from Apple is: check lighting while taking pics.I am not sure why very less people has raised this issue in Xs Camera reviews (started digging more and observed in reviews only after facing the issue)Please note that, iPhone can\u2019t be returned to Amazon without the approval from Apple. Apple don\u2019t agree it\u2019s as issue. Totally disappointed.This might be best Camera in some scenarios, but for me it\u2019s a total disappointment.***Feeling cheated. Nothing wrong with the product. But i saw an ad on insta mentioning iphone xs max 256gb at 1.09 nd here i have an iphone xs 256gb.I dearly wanted an xs max model and now there are not ready to exchange even if i am ready to buy a new one.***Personally i feel the XS is a complete phone. My last Iphone 6 worked flawlessly for 3 yearsI was confused between note 9, xs, one plus 6T and other latest handsets.Finally chose IOS over android as it is more polished than android and the apps in my opinion work better on an IOSDid not go for the Max as i prefer the smaller size.Price is definitely high and i got it in a nice deal from amazon which knocked off 20k on the price tagPlus got free screen replacement cover, no interest EMITips:Wait for a SALE to get maximum savings. This phone is worth it if you are getting it at a good deal. get a cover***While purchasing the item it has been shown that it comes under no EMI cost. But when I received my first credit card statement it shows EMI amount plus interest plus GST cost. Pls clarify.***",

  "cust_review": "I am very much sad to write this review...I have bought Note 9 on 29th Oct, mobile looked and worked as a brand new. But exactly after 8,9 days I got speaker issues... when I am receiving any incoming calls or when I am making any outgoing calls automatically loudspeaker is turned On... while talking in phone without pressing the loudspeaker button automatically it turned On... when I am looking the loudspeaker button it indicates OFF..Same thing when I am hearing songs in loudspeaker sometimes only top speaker working and sometimes only bottom speaker is working...I have googled this issue and found so many people facing the same issue with Note 9 speakers but there is no answers from Samsung...One of the top brand phone having this kind of issues unable to digest...Now I am fighting with Amazon for the replacement...Amazon and seller should help me on this...***Here's the thing...If you buy this device now(i.e. Before note 10 and note 9 price falls) then you would get the best mobile ever in the market but..if u will wait for the price to drop then you'll get best deal ever..choice is your.Anyways about mobile..1. DisplayBest display ever.Fun fact- when the display settings is kept in 1080p then you will only experience 319ppi..so i highly recommend to keep in quad hd+..it hardly uses 30min of your total battery usages.2. PerformanceSnappy as ever..No complaints there.3. BatteryWhen I heard note 9 has 4000mah battery I was hyped because 4000mah battery with very very efficient 9810 processor (10nm chip), Samsung's optimization.. I should get some really good battery life..but that's not the case.. don't get me wrong its has whole day long..but i expected little more.I am getting around 5-5.5 hrs of screen on time daily (with 1.5hr of pubg,2 hr of Netflix streaming,1hr of YouTube and social media on an average day)4.Camera NO Complaints there either.But live focus(portrait mode)on selfie camera needs to be improved.Edge detection is OK but it softens the photo a lot and i mean a lot.5. BuitIt should last 5 years easily.And it has IP68(water and dust resistance)Note- i went for metallic copper colour because of those anodised metal part(the metal frame of the phone).Any small scrap or scratch would be more visible on blue colour and despite of black being my favourite colour i didn't go for black because it doesn't stand out. Its too ordinary for me.!Honourable mention-Speakers are phenomenal,iris scan works perfect, fingerprint scanner is fast, button are clicky,s pen works fine.Verdict-Best phone you can buy right now.And remember S-Pen is great bonus.***One month review: Everything is just amazing. Only thing I was afraid of was on how long it would take to charge but after testing it I hardly even noticed that it finished charging. Great phone overall. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc99After using it for one month usually other phones would slow down but with this I hardly even noticed a difference it's still fast and perfect for gaming. Yet I still haven't found a single problem with it other than the fact that it's a fingerprint magnet. I do reccomend good cases like UAG or Spigen as the phone is front and back glass so if u drop it , it will crack but repair cost is not too expensive so dont worry. Oh and if you find the Bixby button annoying that when u try to increase the volume you pressed the Bixby button by mistake then an update came where u can toggle a switch to make it so that u have to double press the button to activate Bixby. Otherwise Samsung great job\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f***First of all phone gets heated up dispite no usage. It takes 3 hours to full charge. Battery drains considerably. No Android P out of the box. Very Fragile. One fall and back glass crack. Screen protector can't be applied due to curve display. Even back cover provided by Samsung doesnt fit properly.  Overall disappointed. Was expecting much better in this price range.  Phone lags sometimes and hangs despite 8gb Ram. Poco F1 is far better and fast then Note 9***I pre booked the phone.It is really the best phone in the market now. I got Gear watch coupon also. The only thing is HDFC cashback, let's see ...***Not happy with the battery life. Also the tip of the S pen got torn out in just 28 days of use.Samsung, tell me what should I do next regarding this issue.***There's lot had been written with regards to the phones quality and i am not gonna jump into the conclusion yet but there's a thing i want to highlight is that there's very little support for it's accessories like tempered glass. I have yet to find a tempered glass that fits it completely without blocking the screen and stick there for while coz with the given curved Edges it is very difficult to find a tempered glass that would remain attached to the screen from edges and that's my biggest concern.***First of all thanks for Amazon for super product in less price without offer and then to Samsung for this beautiful device bang o n money product  no doubt about performance camera and ram management I basically a camera lover person  so here some pics I attach for night because if you really know about camera click at night and i feel satisfied with Samsung Galaxy Note 9 I can't notice thAT SEAL IS BROKEN 8 FEEL CHEATED***",

  "cust_review": "The reason for buying Nokia 3.1 is primarily due to my two requirements: 1. stock Android, 2. small screen size. Moto G6 & E5 were dropped due to larger screen.\u2022 Phone size is ideal for single-handed use. It is sleek and feels good to hold.\u2022 Stock Android running 8.0. 3GB RAM plus lack of bloatware will help in smooth performance in the long run.\u2022 Blue/Copper colour looks better than the black version. Copper ring around the front panel looks classy.\u2022 Available internal storage is about 22GB. Dual sim + micro SD card.\u2022 Camera is decent. Highest video recording is HD 1080p for rear camera & HD 720p for front. Slow motion & Time lapse feature.\u2022 Rear camera has a small bump.\u2022 In-built FM radio.\u2022 Built quality is good.\u2022 Battery easily lasts more than a day.\u2022 At 139gms, it is lightweight and easy to carry around.\u2022 Should have provided USB Type-C port.\u2022 When on a call, there is noticeable vibration felt on the back panel. This is mostly coming from the earpiece.\u2022 Speaker can often get covered while watching videos.\u2022 No LED notification light in the front.\u2022 Lower bezel is huge. Home/back buttons are placed on-screen. What a waste of real estate!\u2022 The side & back panels are very smooth and is prone to slippage. Case is much needed.\u2022 Should have been priced lower (MRP 12k at the time of review). For someone not particular about stock android, better options are available.***Phone was due for software update. As soon as i setup the phone i got Official OTA software upgrade prompt. Initially software update failed multiple times. Then in another try it just went into boot loop and now it will now switch on. It just restarts automatically and just shows white screen with Android One logo and restarts again. Want to return.***I just got the phone today and I am now facing technical issues with the phone. The phone automatically switches on and off. I contacted the Nokia helpline and they suggested to return the phone in Amazon. After that, I contacted the Amazon helpline and they helped me set up an appointment with a technician tomorrow. I would suggest going with other brands while buying a mobile phone. Maybe Nokia is not what it used to be. Anyway, I'll post a review after the technician visit tomorrow.***I bought this phone on 23rd Feb and received it the next day. On starting the phone, Google prompted for the latest software update. But after the update, the phone goes into an endless boot up cycle - the Android One logo keeps coming on and off over and over again. Now I am waiting for the tech guy to visit me, cant even return this phone. Not happy, not happy at all.***Okay product. Some of functions doesn't work satisfactorily. Android version is not upto mark. Too small display of icons (32 on one screen). Overall disappointed with Nokia.***I actually brought this smartphone phone for someone else. Someone not so tech-savvy. But for the price this phone offers a lot of features. The person I bought for was thrilled to have it. She wasn't expecting these many features at this price point especially from a Brand like Nokia. The build and screen quality is above par. Great battery life and timely software updates make this a great proposition. But screen size is too small I guess. That's one area one would be disappointed while considering to buy this phone. If you are tight on budget, then you should consider Nokia in your options. Nokia does offers a great value for money products.***Cons: The phone heats within 5 min of talk time.Had a discussion with Nokia chat on their support site. Nokia tech support suggests me to switch off mobile data to avoid the heating issue. I do not understand the need of purchasing a 4G phone when the suer has to switch off 4G data to use the phone.An additional suggestion from Nokia tech support is not to worry about the heating. Pathetic response.Please avoid purchasing this phone.***The phone was not functional out of the box - it got stuck in boot screen as soon as the update ran on turning on the phone and is un-usable.  While products can sometimes be defective, what is appalling is the customer service provided by Amazon.  1) In spite of a 10 day return policy advertised for defective products, Amazon refused to take it back 2) They made us jump through hoops like installing additional apps, call at very specific times before connecting with someone 3) Leave alone apologizing for a damaged product, the support technician was asking why we did not initiate return on the same day on receipt, expecting us to stop everything we are doing and set up phone as soon as package was receives. 4) Provided trouble shooting tips that demonstrated zero knowledge of product - kept asking to charge phone 5) Now - more than a week since the issue, we have to make time to meet their technician, who will spend who knows how many days on this, before *maybe* offering a replacement.  Net net - we still don't have a phone that works after a week, and have been forced to purchase another phone.Amazon has a reputation of great customer service in the US, but it is really sad to see how they treat consumers in  India.  Experiences like these are why the Indian consumer doesn't trust and hesitates to use e-commerce.I hope the Amazon India head Amit Agarwal reads this, and improves the customer experience.***",

  "cust_review": "True it\u2019s not a replacement for laptop, but except word document or excel sheet this iPad will do everything for you and with the help of Apple Pencil you somehow start loving the way it works. The processor is fast adding to the speed of multitasking. No other products available in the market will give you the joy of multitasking like iPad do. Split screen, copy paste options, reader highlight, safari browser all this will make your task much easier and one would definitely enjoy the art and craft of this iPad.The only problem I\u2019m facing is with regard to charging time, it does not support fast charging so your iPad might take 4 hours to fully charge which will be a problem keeping the pace and value of time.With regard to battery life once it is fully charged then it will work for a day or two depending upon your nature of work and usage.***I wanted to buy iPhone 8 and was going to order but when I checked that it didn't have headphone jack I was pissed. I checked this was in offer got it for 31k for 128G.Its smooth. Its fast. I played pubg Mobile and Fortnite no issues.. Pubg plays smooth but Fortnite drops frames here and there. I hate Fortnite anyways so doesn't matter.Its been 2 weeks and not opened the camera because I know its a shitty one and didn't buy it to take a photo. Battery life is good actually better than my phone. I play Pubg in low settings so gives me good battery backup. About watching videos is so immersive! I stopped using my OnePlus  after getting this.  It takes a little bit time about 2 hours to get it fully charged. They said that the Air gap is bad! I don't notice it dude. Its great for me. A10 fusion is good but not the fastest You should buy this even if you are a casual phone user or gamer or if you like music(Garageband!!) Its a great device and probably my last ipad also cz newer one's have skipped the headphone jack...***First IPad of my life.Excellent for studies..128 gb capacity is absolutely fantastic for storing all books in pdf..Battery is too good..Screen resolution is really untiring for eyes..Butter smooth operation..Value for money product..Camera is not upto the mark but not a matter of concern if you have a good mobile cam..***One of the coolest device out in the market. Its My first tab. Since the I bought the tab i am using my iphone just for calling. It is fun to work on ios over a big screen. Bought it for 28k.... apple ecosystem is amazing. Still there are things i need to do on laptop. But watching movies and stuff was nevere so fun. The best part is battery life....processor is awesome but in terms of battery life its a beast. Was planning to upgrade to iphone x, for bigger screen, better processor and more memory, and thank goodness i settled for the ipad. Really saved a lot of money. It is a value for money. Only downside is that i didn\u2019t got the gst invoice. Amazon fooled me saying you will get gst invoice if ur a business user. Apart from this no issues with this purchase.***Ipad has always been the go to tablet. The apps just work better on an iPad than any other tablet. You simply can't get a better tablet than an iPad. Plenty of storage(128gig).,good battery life and great performance.. Only tiny downside is that you can cleary see the gap between the display and the glass***Its apple what can you expect.... Totally superb product.....light weight.... performance good...battery life is nice....in short wthevr they have mentioned in product description its exactly like  that ..so far hvnt met with any issue with product ......jst bit expensive but totally worthy....i was bit worried wthr i will get genuine product or not ,bt thanks to amazon for providing nice product at less price....***It was a substantial sum I was putting out. Never bought expensive items without checking and feeling and seeing in front of your eyes. When it came, it came sealed with specific markers that ensured the item is genuine. Was very relieved and happy.Great product.***I bought the 128 gb version for reading and taking notes. It's been a great companion ever since to read the textbooks while lying on bed or even better than mobile phone for quick references. Note taking on apps like notability and good notes has been a pretty good experience. Battery life is awesome.  A value for money product and thanks a lot amazon for bringing out such great offers with on time delivery.***",
